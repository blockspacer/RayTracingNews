this time is Rod Bogart's triangle intersector, and the announcement of
Baldev Singh's computer graphics reference resource.  There are also many

I am in the PhD program in Computer Sciences at the University of Texas.  My
research area is developing a more sophisticated illumination model than those
currently in widespread use.  A modified form of distributed ray tracing is one
of the methods I am considering to evaluate my model.
<P>
Animation is another of my interests.  I am putting myself through school by
producing computer graphics animations for a small engineering company.
Sometimes I am called upon to create special effects such as motion blur and
atmospheric effects.  Based on what I heard at this year's ray tracing round
table at SIGGRAPH, it looks as if ray tracing can solve most of my problems.

Ray/Triangle Intersection with Barycentric Coordinates,
</A></FONT>
by Rod Bogart, Jeff Arenberg
</H4>
From: hpfcla!bogart%<A HREF="mailto:gr@cs.utah.edu">gr@cs.utah.edu</A> (Rod G. Bogart)
<P>
A while back, there was a posting concerning ray/triangle intersection.  The
goal was to determine if a ray intersects a triangle, and if so, what are the
barycentric coordinates.  For the uninitiated, barycentric coordinates are
three values (r,s,t) all in the range zero to one.  Also, the sum of the values
is one.  These values can be used as interpolation parameters for data which is
known at the triangle vertices (i.e. normals, colors, uv).
<P>
The algorithm presented previously involved a matrix inversion.  The math went
something like this: Since (r,s,t) are interpolation values, then the
intersection point (P) must be a combination of the triangle vertices scaled by
(r,s,t).
<P>
<PRE>
    [ x1 y1 z1 ] [ r ]   [ Px ]   [ r ]   [ Px ]
    [ x2 y2 z2 ] [ s ] = [ Py ]   [ s ] = [ Py ]  ~V
    [ x3 y3 z3 ] [ t ]   [ Pz ]   [ t ]   [ Pz ]
</PRE>
<P>
So, by inverting the vertex matrix (V -&gt; ~V), and given any point in the plane
of the triangle, we can determine (r,s,t).  If they are in the range zero to
one, the point is in the triangle.
<P>
The only problem with this method is numerical instability.  If one vertex is
the origin, the matrix won't invert.  If the triangle lies in a coordinate
plane, the matrix won't invert.  In fact, for any triangle which lies in a
plane through the origin, the matrix won't invert.  (The vertex vectors don't
span R3.)  The reason this method is so unstable is because it tries to solve a
2D problem in 3D.  Once the ray/plane intersection point is known, the
barycentric coordinates solution is a 2D issue.
<P>
Another way to think of barycentric coordinates is by the relative areas of the
subtriangles defined by the intersection point and the triangle vertices.
<P>
<PRE>
        1         If the area of triangle 123 is A, then the area of
       /|\        P23 is rA.  Area 12P is sA and area 1P3 is tA.
      / | \       With this image, it is obvious that r+s+t must equal
     /  |  \      one.  If r, s, or t go outside the range zero to one,
    / t | s \     P will be outside the triangle.
   /  _-P-_  \
  / _-     -_ \
 /_-    r    -_\
2---------------3
</PRE>
<P>
By using the above are relationships, the following equations define r, s and
t.
<P>
<PRE>
        N = triangle normal = (vec(1 2) cross vec(1 3))
            (vec(1 P) cross vec(1 3)) dot N
        s = -------------------------------
                     (length N)^2
            (vec(1 2) cross vec(1 P)) dot N
        t = -------------------------------
                     (length N)^2
        r = 1 - (s + t)
</PRE>
<P>
In actual code, it is better to avoid the divide and the square root.  So, you
can set s equal to the numerator, and then test if s is less than zero or
greater than sqr(length N).  For added efficiency, preprocess the data and
store sqr( length N) in the triangle data structure.  Even for extremely long
thin triangles, this method is accurate and numerically stable.

Subject: Re: Ray/Triangle Intersection with Barycentric Coordinates
[from USENET]
<P>
Ok, here is how I handle this calculation in my ray tracing program.  I think
it is quite efficient.
<P>
Let a triangle be represented in the following manner :
<P>
<PRE>
                   |\
                   |  \
                p1 |    \
                   |      \
  O ------------&gt;  |________\
       p0              p2
</PRE>
<P>
where p0 is the vector from the origin to one vertex and p1, p2 are the vectors
from the first vertex to the other two vertices.
<P>
<PRE>
Let N =   p1 X p2  be the normal to the triangle.
          -------
        | p1 X p2 |
</PRE>
<P>
Construct the matrices
<P>
<PRE>
    b =  |  p1  | ,  bb = inv(b) = | bb[0] |
         |  p2  |                  | bb[1] |
         |  N   |                  | bb[2] |
</PRE>
<P>
and store away bb.
<P>
Let the intersecting ray be parameterizes as
<P>
<PRE>
    r = t * D + P
</PRE>
<P>
Now you can quickly intersect the ray with the triangle using the following
pseudo code. ( . means vector dot product)
<P>
<PRE>
    Den = D . bb[2]
    if (Den == 0) then ray parallel to triangle plane, so return
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
    Num = (p0 - P) . bb[2]
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
    t = Num / Den
    if (t &lt;= 0) then on or behind triangle, so return
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
    p = t * D + P - p0
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
    a = p . bb[0]
    b = p . bb[1]
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
    if (a &lt; 0.0 || b &lt; 0.0 || a + b &gt; 1.0) then not in triangle and return
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
    b1 = 1 - a - b     /* barycentric coordinates */
    b2 = a
    b3 = b
</PRE>
<P>
The idea here is that the matrix bb transforms to a coordinate frame where the
sides of the triangle form the X,Y axes and the normal the Z axis of the frame
and the sides have been scaled to unit length.  The variable Den represents the
dZ component of the ray in this frame.  If dZ is zero, then the ray must be
parallel to the X,Y plane.  Num is the Z location of the ray origin in the new
frame and t is simply the parameter in both frames required to intersect the
ray with the triangle's plane.  Once t is known, the intersection point is
found in the original frame, saved for latter use, and the X,Y coordinates of
this point are found in the triangle's frame.  A simple comparison is then made
to determine if the point is inside the triangle.  The barycenter coordinates
are also easily found.
<P>
I haven't seen this algorithm in any of the literature, but then I haven't
really looked either.  If anyone knows if this approach has been published
before, I'd really like to know about it.

Transforming normals,
</A></FONT>
by David F. Rogers (hpfcla!<A HREF="mailto:dfr@USNA.MIL">dfr@USNA.MIL</A>)
</H4>
G'day Eric,
<P>
Was skimming the back issues of the RT News and your memo on transforming
normals caught my eye. Another way of looking at the problem is to recall
that a polygonal volume is made up of planes that divide space into two
parts. The columns of the volume matrix are formed from the coefficients of
the plane equations. Transforming a volume matrix requires that you
premultiply by the inverse of the manipulation matrix. The components of a
normal are the first three coefficients of the plane equation. Hence the
same idea should apply. (see PECG Sec. 4-3 on Robert's algorithm pp 211-213).
Surprising what you can learn from Roberts' algorithm yet most people
discount it.

An answer to the question of Jack Ritter, RT-News October 3, 1988,
    by Jack van Wijk
<P>
Jack Ritter proposes a method to improve the efficiency by testing the
ray-point against a 2-D box. This method has been published before:
<P>
Bronsvoort, W.F., J.J. van Wijk, and F.W. Jansen, "Two methods for Improving
the Efficiency of Ray Casting in Solid Modelling", Computer-Aided Design,
16(1), January 1984, pp. 51-55.
<P>
The method is used hierarchically here for CSG-defined models, in the spirit of
Roth. The gain of the method is significant, but not dramatically.  Probably in
our system the cost of the floating point intersection calculations was much
bigger than the box-test.

   Yuk.  I don't think that the world needs another ugly scene description
language unless it does something special.  I haven't seen renderman, but other
people seem to like it, so maybe that'll be better.  Yours looks a lot like
Wavefront's, with the disadvantage that it doesn't support a binary
representation.
<P>
    I hate to say it, but I use my own (less, I feel, but still ugly) text
format that does have a binary format as well as an ascii numerical format.
You are welcome to it if you want, but I would doubt it.  It's different in
that algebraic expressions are possible in place of any constant, plus it
includes flow control, tests, some computer algebra-type primitives and macros.
Plus, a historyer, command line editing, etc.  It looks a lot like an
interactive F77 interpreter with massive numbers of bizarre graphics commands.
<P>
    Perhaps you can instigate an effort to create a sensible object description
language and (maybe) supply an interpreter and some compiled formats.  It would
be worthwhile.  Perhaps just setting up an effort to spec one out would be good
enough.  Whatever.
<P>

        I guess I didn't make it clear - NFF has been in use about a year now.
It's the format that the SPD benchmarking package uses.  I should have written
a better preface, obviously: I wanted to get the point across that this is
supposed to be absolutely minimal, and that no one should be using it for
modeling, but only for transferring the final database to a renderer.  There
could indeed be an NFF++ language which would not be user hostile, like NFF is.
Essentially, I see NFF as incredibly stupid and brain damaged.  This makes it
accessible to almost anyone who simply wants to read in a scene database
without too much hassle (even now, though, I'm getting questions like "what's
hither?" from people on USENET).
<P>
        Anyway, I like your ideas for algebraic expressions - I could use it
right now in my other language, which is a tad more user friendly and is what I
use when I want to munge around by hand.

Reply From: Jeff Goldsmith
<P>
    Hmmm.  If you are trying to find an interface that can be used by
professionals, then it is probably not the same interface that might be used by
USENET-types.  Both problems might be worth addressing, but I'd say (from gross
personal bias) that the high-end problem is worth doing more.  Simply so that I
can trade databases more easily.  Simply so that code can be shared more
easily.  I'm really not all that concerned about getting computer graphics
capabilities out to high schoolers and other randoms quite yet.  In fact, I
doubt that graphics will have that sort of distribution in its current
"modeler-renderer" form.  I suspect that Mac interface and high-quality
user-interfaces will be the medium for that type of technology dissemination.
Eventually, we'll have programs that are called "Graphics Processors" or some
other nonsense and will be transmitting reasonably complex graphics
capabilities to anyone who wants to do it.  Artists will be the primary users,
though managers and engineers will use them in both technical and non-
technical efforts.  Joe six-pack just doesn't have that much
use/interest/capacity for generating pictures out of thin air.
<P>
    It would be really nice if there were a standardish graphics language
kernel.  Since just about everybody has their own interpreter that does just
about the same set of very basic things, plus, of course, their set of
enhancements, why not create a spec that would still allow all the
enhancements, but cover the basics thoroughly.  It might stifle creativity a
bit, but I doubt it.
<P>
    For transmission between modelers and renders, why not use the same
language as input to modelers?  Remove some options (or don't) and keep the
files the same.  If you are worried about speed, then a binary complied version
is necessary in any event.  (Case in point: my current project is Hubble Space
Telescope.  The uncompiled model takes 17! minutes to read in.  The compiled
one takes about 35 seconds.)  It might also be worth considering that some
people out there do use Fortran and that some things are hard to parse (NFF,
for example) in Fortran.  In fact, it's hard to parse anything that isn't fixed
field formatted in Fortran.  (I've got an ugly version like that, too.  Really
ugly.  .7 Fixmans maybe even.)

        In their paper, they mention that the probability of hitting a bounding

by the surface area of the bounding volume of the object(s).

        Jeff Goldsmith and I were discussing in the latest RT News whether the
eye location might be used to help out the hierarchy made by the Goldsmith/
Salmon algorithm.  Essentially, Jeff finds that since so many of his rays are
eye rays, he might want to try to test intersection of the objects closer to
the eye first.  In other words, after the G-S hierarchy is created, go through
and sort the sons of each bounding volume by the additional criterion of
distance to the eye.  This is an added fillip to the G-S algorithm: normally
(i.e. in the original article) they do not pay attention to the order of the
sons of a bounding volume.  The idea is that if you test the closer object
first and hit it, you can often quickly reject the further object when it is
tested (since you now have a maximum bound on the distance the ray is shot).
For example, say you have a list: polygon, sphere.  The closest approach (or
the center, or whatever criterion you decide to use) of the sphere is closer
than that of the polygon, so you reorder the son list: sphere, polygon.  If you
now test a ray against this list you get four possibilities:
<P>
<PRE>
        1) Sphere missed, polygon missed - no savings is accrued by sorting.
        2) Sphere missed, polygon hit - no savings is accrued by sorting.
        3) Sphere hit, polygon missed - by hitting the sphere, we now have
           a maximum bound on the ray's (really the line segment's) length.
           Now when the polygon is tested it might be quickly rejected. Say
           we hit the polygon plane beyond the maximum distance.  In this
           case, we can stop testing the polygon without doing the inside-
           outside testing.  If we had intersected in the order "polygon,
           sphere", we would have had to do this inside-outside test, then
           gone on to test the sphere - extra work we could have avoided.
        4) Sphere hit, polygon hit - Pretty much the same as case (3), except
           even more so:  in this case time is saved by (a) not having to
           to do the inside-outside test, (b) not having to store information
           about the intersected polygon, and (c) it is all the more likely
           that a polygon beyond the sphere which is actually hit has the
           intersection distance beyond the sphere's intersection distance
           (vs. a missed polygon, where the intersection distance is somewhere
           on an infinite plane which could easily be in front of the sphere).

<P>
        My idea for ordering the son lists was simply object size: within a son
list, sort from largest to smallest area, on the theory that larger objects
will tend to get hit more often and so get you an intersection point quickly.
The savings are based more on probability of hits, but the idea makes for G-S
hierarchy trees that are not eye-dependent (I use item buffering, so eye rays
are minimized).  Another idea is to order the lists by difficulty of
calculation: test spheres before splines, test triangles before 100-sided
polygons, etc.
<P>
        The idea of ordering lists by either size or difficulty is valid for
other efficiency schemes, too.  Octree lists and SEADS might benefit from
ordering the lists in a sensible fashion.  Has anyone else out there tried such
schemes?

Yes, I understood these discussions and they are all valid.  Somehow just
trying to optimize the eye rays doesn't impress me very much because you
yourself have mentioned the item buffer for eye rays and the light buffer for
doing shadow rays from the first level intersections.  It is not very clear to
me if the above schemes you mention will bear a great improvement.  Anyhow, I
am really interested in secondary rays since that's what ray tracing is all
about. In very complex scenes like the Cornell rings or Cornell mountain
databases (SPD data bases) its the secondary rays that are dominant.
<P>
My real question was trying to figure out if Jeff's approximation in using the
surface area of the bounding volumes to figure out the conditional
probabilities was valid for all rays, primary and secondary.  There he said
something like 'if you are far away, you can approximate ........'. Does this
refer to the ray length ?

        Indeed, Jeff's optimization for eye rays doesn't thrill me.  But how do
you feel about optimizing on size or on intersection complexity (or both)?
Seems like this has a good chance of validity for secondary rays, too.

        I should clear up an important point: the SPD databases are in no way
connected with Cornell.  I designed them in August 1987, more than a year and a
half after leaving Cornell.  I hope that nowhere in the document I imply that
Cornell is associated with these.  Why the fuss?  Partly because Don Greenberg,
my president (at 3D/Eye Inc) is very firm about separating work done at 3D/Eye
and work done at the Cornell graphics lab (which he also runs).  Another reason
is that Cornell doesn't "endorse" these databases - Don would be pretty bugged
at me if it was said that they did.  So, please just refer to the SPD
databases, or the 3D/Eye SPD databases.  'Nuff said, and thanks.

        You are right. Using size or intersection cost in ordering your
intersections will do good, especially in shadow ray computation. As far as the
pixel or reflection rays are concerned, this depends on the method used. I have
a modified version of the BSP tree where the search goes very close to the path
of the ray and only on collection of unordered objects can we take advantage of
the above 2 facts.
<P>
        Also, this is basically a hack (well, I wouldn't go quite that far).
But size as presented to a ray depends on the direction of the ray, since
projected area on to a ray varies.  A polygon could present its entire area to
a ray orthogonal to it or almost nothing if its parallel to it.
<P>
        For shadow rays, if you have a mix of complex objects (patches, splines
etc) and simple objects like polygons, spheres you better do this in the order
of their complexity. That will definitely save a lot of work especially when
there are multiple light sources and lots of spawned rays.

Ok.  Optimizations.
<P>
    1) The only reason that I suggest ordering from the eye is that there are
eye rays in all scenes.  Not true for secondary.  Besides, most secondary rays
get other kludges.  More importantly, they are somewhat random, so it's tough
to optimize for them.
<P>
    2) What he is confusing with the above is the heuristic for "probability"
determination.  That is not based on eye rays, but assumes a uniform
distribution of ray directions throughout the scene.  This is not the case, but
we haven't dealt with more complicated heuristics other than to decide that
they are a bit more tricky than they might seem.
<P>
    3) There is a factor in the tree combination heuristic (the one that adds
up the node costs into a tree cost) that is biased for primary rays.  I call
the tree cost the sum of the node costs.  This isn't strictly true for
secondary rays, because they emanate from a leaf node, thereby adding some
additional cost to the big nodes.  We tried accounting for this by using a
formulation that takes internal emanation costs into account.  Yes, it was more
accurate.  Not by enough to bother with.  I think the difference was on the
order of a few percent.  It was definitely well under the noise level.  We
don't use it anymore for no particular reason.  Don't bother to code it, except
as an intellectual exercise.  (Not a bad one at that.)

Mirrors, and "Virtual Lighting", by Steve Stadnicki
</H4>
[from USENET]
<P>
     I am currently working on a simple raytracer (VERY simple--so far it only
models triangles) and have a major problem.  For shadow calculations I need to
know if there are any light sources which could shine on a point.  The problem?
With mirrors in the scene, it's possible to have reflected light illuminate
some section that would normally be in shadow, e. g.:
<P>
<PRE>
Light-&gt; O                               |                               O'

----------------------------------------|
</PRE>
<P>
Then the area covered by the S's would not be in shadow, even though it isn't
directly illuminated by the light O.  I know how to solve the problem using
"virtual" lights; that is, a light that you would obtain if you reflected the
Light at O in the mirror above; it would appear at O'.  Multiple reflections
can be handled by re-reflecting virtual lights, etc.  So what's my problem?
Simple: if you have M mirrors and reflections can go up to depth K, you need
O(M^K) virtual lights for each "real" light.  Is there any way I might be able
to eliminate, for a given point, some combinations of reflections without
having to do much testing?

There's nothing in the SIGGRAPH 88 proceedings about RenderMan.  You can

    San Rafael, Ca. 94901
<P>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;((( The following is MY understanding of Renderman )))<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;Renderman is an attempt by PIXAR to force a de facto standard interface in the<BR>
&gt;Graphics Rendering/Imaging arena.  My understanding is that this interface<BR>
&gt;is based on tools/routines that they have developed throughout the years for<BR>
&gt;use on their hardware.  Because it was not designed for general/varying<BR>
&gt;graphics architectures, many companies wonder if it will only work well on<BR>
&gt;their systems -- hence, making their hardware also the de facto standard.<BR>
<P>
RenderMan is based on about six years' research at Pixar and Lucasfilm on
how to get quasi-photographic realism into computer graphics.  The effort
has encompassed algorithms, software and hardware, and much of what is in
the standard has been proven to work by actually implementing it;  so in
some sense the above is a correct statement.  However, there is an
implication here that RenderMan is some in-house methodology that Pixar is
trying to foist off on the rest of the industry.  That is definitely
untrue.  Pat Hanrahan and Tom Porter spent about six months talking to
other companies in the industry, trying to establish a consensus and
ensure that the standard is technically sound.  The best evidence I
have of how much it changed as a result is the amount of work I had
to put into changing my book between Versions 2 and 3 of the spec.
<P>
As for the standard being specific to some particular hardware or
software configuration, you just have to look at the standard itself.
From the geometric standpoint, it is a simple protocol for describing
scenes, as generic as can be, and deliberately so.  It is essentially
a superset of PHIGS+, with two differences: there is no provision for
changing model descriptions once defined (you have to respecify scenes
from one frame to another), and there are extensions for realism like
the shading language, motion blur and depth-of-field.  The hardware-
specificity is a canard, pure and simple.  The current (incomplete)
version of our software runs on Sun, Silicon Graphics and '386-based
Compaq machines, as well as on Transputer-based hardware accelerators
in all three.
<P>
More specifically, I can tell you that Pat went to a lot of trouble to
make the interface standard independent of even the basic rendering
algorithm.  That is, RenderMan is consistent with scanline-based methods
as well as ray tracing; standard shading models as well as radiosity
techniques.  That wasn't easy.
<P>
&gt;More importantly, PIXAR already has the software written for this "standard"<BR>
&gt;so if this becomes a standard, any competitor of PIXAR would have to make the<BR>
&gt;$$$ investment to write this software -- a good way to limit your competition.<BR>
<P>
Sorry.  I'm working closely with the software group in trying to
generate pictures and example programs for my book, and I can testify
that the software, while quite far along, is not "already written",
largely because of extensions to the standard that came out of
discussions with other companies.  True enough, we probably have a
head start on others, but the standard has been out there for five
months now, and will probably have been around for close to a year
before Pixar has its stuff on the market.
<P>
Besides, the standard specifies nine capabilities which are optional for
any particular implementation.  No renderer should have any trouble
meeting the RenderMan standard if it supports PHIGS primitives and
performs such quality calculations as anti-aliasing and gamma correction.
<P>
&gt;PIXAR made a big push for Renderman at Siggraph 88.  Although a few companies<BR>
&gt;agreed to endorse this package (SUN, of course ... they'd endorse anything to<BR>
&gt;get their name in lights ;-), many took a more intelligent approach and said<BR>
&gt;that they would evaluate it.  PIXAR basically used a lot of marketing hype<BR>
&gt;to get support initially and even listed supporters who, when you would<BR>
&gt;walk up to their booth at Siggraph and ask them, said they did not support it.<BR>
<P>
This comment is borderline offensive to me, partly because it is admittedly
based on speculation and partly because I was around during the process
I mentioned above, and I know what a painful and elaborate job Pat had
to get the proposal into shape to win the support of the companies he did.
There is a difference between endorsement and support.  Endorsement means
"we have evaluated this; it is sound and we believe this is the way the
industry should go".  Support means "we have hardware and/or software
which implements this standard".  You would expect the latter to be a
subset of the former.
<P>
Nineteen companies endorsed the RenderMan standard at rollout.  The main
holdouts at this point are Silicon Graphics and Wavefront.  My personal
suspicion (not to be taken as the views of Pixar) is that Wavefront
perceives RenderMan as a threat to their rendering market because
it supports features which would be difficult or impossible to
implement using their rendering algorithm.  And Wavefront software
runs on SGI machines.
<P>
&gt;Many (most ?) of the companies who looked at Renderman have decided that it<BR>
&gt;still needs a lot of work before it can be considered as even a base to start<BR>
&gt;the development of a standard in the rendering/imaging arena.<BR>
<P>
Who are these "many companies"??  What is this "lot of work"??  We would
love to hear about.  There is a RenderMan Advisory Council made up of
industry representatives whose job it is to hear complaints like that.
<P>
I don't expect to hear too many of them, however.  As I said before,
RenderMan is basically a simple-minded extension of PHIGS (read: EXTENSION.
Meaning "If PHIGS is good enough for you, so should be RenderMan")
adding constructs for supporting realistic graphics.  It has gone
through the mill of two major rewrites as a result of consultations
with "many companies".
<P>
&gt;There are<BR>
&gt;several problems in the area of getting Renderman to mesh with other current<BR>
&gt;standard graphics environments (eg. phigs, cgi, ...) so that it becomes a<BR>
&gt;natural extension to the less-interesting/fancy graphics people do today.<BR>
<P>
What are these problems??  Can you be more specific??
<P>
&gt;Even for the niche market of image-rendering, Renderman does not include<BR>
&gt;many (any ?) ideas from the companies that have been in this business for<BR>
&gt;years ...  Wavefront, Alias Research, Neo-Visuals, Disney, etc.<BR>
<P>
What are these ideas??  Come to think of it, what ideas has Disney
contributed to image rendering?
<P>
&gt;Keith Fish<BR>
&gt;<BR>
&gt;PS. I'm not cutting down PIXAR -- I think that the work they do is<BR>
&gt;    fantastic (literally)!  I just don't like marketing ploys to degrade<BR>
&gt;    what should be good technology, and this is what the Renderman-hype<BR>
&gt;    seems to be.<BR>
<P>
I appreciate your appreciation, but I wish I knew where these
impressions of yours came from.
<P>
&gt;    I think that the industry can develop a good imaging<BR>
&gt;    interface standard if everyone (animation software companies,<BR>
&gt;    universities, graphics hardware companies, etc.) gets to contribute.<BR>
<P>
Again, I thought that's exactly what we did.
<P>
If anyone on the net is interested in more information on RenderMan
without investing $15 in a spec, the current issue of Unix Review
includes an article I wrote discussing the major aspects of the
standard.  Also, the November issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal has a
cover story on the shading language, which is RenderMan's doorway
for extensibility.

Coverage in the field (for graphics) is quite good.  I know, I am trying to
maintain a comprehensive study of another field (see postings in comp.arch or

difficult (I won't get into details, take my word).  Frequently entries are
also wrong (not as bad as the net however).

A machine readable form however, solves many of these problems.  You can update
a machine readable form.  The problem becomes then of distribution and search,
surprise! something computers are good for!  It is with this back ground that
we in the Bay Area Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group

Internet site with lots of users, it's kind of dumb if you ALL made personal
copies (n megabytes ;-).  So before you copy, agree who at your site will
oversee obtaining it.  One copy per site please.
<P>
The second danger is everybody copying at the same time.  The information which
follows will illustrate the problem.  The DEC host which you be copying from is
DEC's gateway to the Internet.  It will be a tragedy to abuse this gateway if
every site tried to copy at once.  I know, we provide the 9600 baud IMP port to
DEC.  So let's not abuse this, let's be patient and take our turns. 1) copy the
computer graphics bibliography only during the weekends or evenings Pacific
Daylight or Standard time. 2) copy on a randomly determined evening of the
week.  How?  Flip a coin 3 times (say HTH, make Head == 0, Tails == 1, this
translates to 010 binary or 2 base 10). Using Sunday as 1, make Monday 2, copy
Monday evening P[SD]T.  (HHH or 000, retry).  If this is confusing, wait for
the weekend. AGAIN copy only in the evenings.
<P>
Now the questions you have all been patiently waiting for and I have been
rambling: where do I get, and how do I get it.  The Internet host is the
machine <A HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com">gatekeeper.dec.com</A> [128.45.9.52].  Please respect this machine (hacker
ethic) for the assistance DEC is providing.  We don't wish to yank the
bibliography from this machine.  Don't try to break in, please.
<P>
Old time ARPAnet hackers will know where to go from here.  The "how" is a
process called anonymous FTP (File Transfer Protocol or Program, hasn't changed
since 1973 ;-)] Don't all do this at once.  Below is a sample session with
annotation as to how this works.  Catch the names of the subdirectories and
files below.  A lot of people aren't familiar with distributed systems other
than Email, so we've made the language oversimplistic, if you have problems
consult your local network guru.
<P>
Note the bibliographies exist in a data compressed binary form.  Use the Unix
uncompress(1) command to decode them.  Not on a Unix system?  Tough for the
time being.  Try to find one.  The further format of individual entries is Unix
refer format (a sample, see the two references above).  This is how Singh has
them, and also how my bibliography is stored.  Refer has lots of advantages
over other systems: free-format, widely available on Unix systems, uses a
minimum of space, ASCII, fully machine and human readable (it separates the
binary data from the text), fairly easy to learn, easily converted to other
formats (like [bib]TeX, Scribe, etc.)
<P>

Start script

  18 bytes received in 0.2 seconds (0.09 Kbytes/s)
  ftp&gt; mget *
       ^^^^^^ asks for all (star) files
  mget bib85.Z?
  mget bib86.Z?
                ^ you type "y &lt;cr&gt;" or "n &lt;cr&gt;" if you want them.
                NOTE: THIS WILL TAKE SOME TIME.
  ftp&gt; quit
       ^^^^  done
  221 Goodbye.

very tired of this. That's why I'm doing this.)  Big thanks are due to Brian
Reid and Jamie Painter (at DEC for this work).  Rick Beach okay'ed ACM
copyrights.  This is not for profit.  Please ACK the above people and
organizations (in particular, Baldev) when citing.  As I hope you can tell, we
are really trying to advance the state of the art in computer graphics.  This
should benefit experts as well as students alike.  It also shows the use of
technologies other than graphics to our (graphics) benefit.

Subject: A little announcement (part 2 of 3)
<P>
I described the advantages of searching and reformatting.  I described
anonymous FTP.  This is the way to go if you are a major Internet site like
most universities.  The problem is: what about more casual users, poor people
with small disks?  Well, the files reside of DEC's disk.  Just LEAVE THEM
THERE.  Let Bay Area ACM/SIGGRAPH and Singh maintain them.  Then how do you
access it?  By electronic mail.
<P>
A similar system exists at the Argonne National Labs (and AT&T Bell Labs):
netlib numerical software distribution [CACM ref. if you need it].  A similar
set up for benchmarks exists at the NBS (See latest IEEE Computer).  Why not do
this for graphics references?
<P>
With a generous donation of cycles and disk space from the Digital Equipment
Corporation (DEC) and some software from CSIL at Stanford we have done just
this.
<P>
THERE ARE TWO DANGERS inherent: The bibliography is kind of big.  The second
danger is everybody copying at the same time.
<P>
The DEC host which you be copying from is DEC's gateway to the Internet.  It
will be a tragedy to abuse this gateway if every site tried to copy at once.
So let's not abuse this, let's be patient and take our turns.
<P>
1) retrieve references only during the weekends or evenings Pacific Daylight or
Standard time.
<P>
2) copy on a randomly determined evening of the week.  How?  Flip a coin 3
times (say THT make Head == 0, Tails == 1, this translates to 101 binary or 5
base 10). Using Sunday as 1, make Thursday 5, copy Thursday evening P[SD]T.
(HHH or 000, retry).  If this is confusing, wait for the weekend. AGAIN copy
only in the evenings.
<P>
<PRE>
Where, okay here goes the dangerous information:
        send mail to:
        <A HREF="mailto:graf-bib-server@decwrl.dec.com">graf-bib-server@decwrl.dec.com</A>
This can also be
        {your favorite UUCP path}!decwrl!graf-bib-server
or if you work for DEC and have ENET access:
        DECWRL::graf-bib-server
</PRE>
<P>
Your mailer should ask for a "Subject:" field.  This is important.  If your
mailer doesn't (and lots don't) ask your system folk about mailrc file or
mh_profiles or how to invoke this field.  Because you should place the keywords
in that subject field.  One special keyword is "help."  You get a short little
description.  Make the first alphanumeric (don't give "years").  Additional
keywords are conjective (and's) causing a smaller and smaller search.  The
contents aren't perfect, but give us time.
<P>
Your mail is answered by the server daemon.  It searches and tries to find
relevant cited keywords (up to 6 significant first characters.  Choose
carefully.  Don't ask for all references with "computer graphics."  Hope you
understand why.  Just try "help" as your first keyword unless you know what you
are looking for.  The information comes back in the aforementioned (yesterday)
refer format.
<P>
If you don't have a network guru, send mail to siggraph, not the poster of this
note below.  (Illiterates will type "reply" or "follow-up" to news.  Sorry, I'm
very tired of this. That's why I'm doing this.)  Big thanks are due to Brian
Reid and Jamie Painter (at DEC for this work).  Rick Beach okay'ed ACM

are really trying to advance the state of the art in computer graphics.  This
should benefit experts as well as students alike.  It also shows the use of
technologies other than graphics to our (graphics) benefit.
<P>
Our last note will concern one more way of getting references: just asking for
a floppy (low tech).  We in the Bay Area ACM/SIGGRAPH local group will be
adding to these.  Reference contributions and corrections are welcome.  It's
only possible if we work together to see this through.

&gt;I got Eugene Miya's bib files over the weekend. There are some<BR>

&gt;1. Some \(em or (em  in the %J field. What these mean?<BR>

&gt;<BR>
&gt;3. Some acronyms: CGF, CAMP, ISATA. They are not defined in the files.<BR>
<P>
Oops!  Sorry. I got other mail on this.  I forgot all about them.  The
BACKSLASH macros are troff-isms.  There are tools like deroff to take them out
or r2bib to convert things into bibTeX.  These macros are 4 characters in size
\(em is a slightly longer dash.  They aren't a significant problem, write sed
filter.
<P>
The I fields are ACM Classification codes.  You can either get them from ACM
Computing Reviews (blue and white things, that most don't get) or you can get
the hardcopy versions of these bibliographies (they have the CR classification
scheme for graphics).
<P>
The acronyms are unfortunately a long term problems.  We can get a table to use
use U. AZ's bib program to fill them out.
<P>
I hope you are all finding some use of this stuff.  We NEED people around the
country to help us update this.  There are earlier years.  Also new papers are
being written all the time.  They have to get entered (even finding them is
hard).  I don't deserve the credit, I'm only pissed off that I have to read
queries over and over.  The credit belongs to the crew of Bay Area ACM/SIGGRAPH
working on this project. (other volunteers are welcome: especially key entry
help)
