Ugh, what a backlog!  I've tried for a month to find time to catch up with the
deluge but seem to be running on a treadmill (so how many mixed metaphors is
that?).  Anyway, I'm going to put out what I've got - think of this issue as
coming out in April.  The "Roundup" is huge, I tried to whittle what I could,
but there's been a lot of activity out there.
<P>
SIGGRAPH:  yes, there will be another gathering of the clans, i.e. the
seventh meeting of the Ray Tracing Roundtable.  Sounds impressive?  Well, it's
simply an excuse to have a chance to meet other people interested in ray
tracing and put names to faces.  As usual, I'll give a brief intro, people go
around the room and briefly introduce themselves, then we split up and talk
about whatever.  This year we'll meet as a Birds of a Feather group (BOF), so
look at the BOF sign at Registration for what room we're in.  I plan on a 5:15
pm meeting on Thursday after the papers.  By the way, we're not a SIG this
year because SIGGRAPH is charging $100 or so for setup/cleanup fees or
somesuch from SIGs, but BOFs still seem to be free.
<P>

So who invented ray tracing?  Most people will say Appel in 1968, though
twelve years later Whitted did the paper that brought it all together,
and Doug Kay also was working along similar lines at the time.  On the net the
idea was floated that ray tracing came out of nuclear weapon testing.  True,
rays were used in simulations, but this would be called ray casting at best -
it was not used to render realistic images.  By the same logic, explorers of
analytic geometry and ray/object intersections could be considered the
inventors.  Watt and Watt propose that Descartes was one of the first ray
tracers because of his analysis of the rainbow.  By widening the definition of
ray tracing even more, it's maintained that Durer or one of his contemporaries
was the inventor of ray tracing (you know, all those frustum and vanishing
point drawings from around the Renaissance).
<P>
This question does bring up another that's a bit more profound:  would
computer science have any existence without computers?  Some universities with
a strong theory department would have us believe that computers are irrelevant
to computer science.  Sure, there was Boolean logic and finite math before
computers, but it's interesting to contemplate how much (data structures,
sorting, networks, languages, you name it...) would not exist if there was no
hardware to make the theory have a point to it.  Computer science would be a
disparate set of specialities in mathematics and nothing more.  A lot of computer
graphics would go away, with some linear algebra and analytic geometry being
all that would be of interest.  Certainly the idea of figuring out a pixel's
color would be up there with figuring out the next decimal place of pi as far
as usefulness went.  What would people have thought of Foley & Van Dam &
Feiner & Hughes _Computer Graphics_ if it were sent back 50 years?
<P>
Anyway, I like the answer that Appel invented ray tracing, then rightly
ignored it as too expensive for the computers of 1968.

Ray Tracer Races, Round 2,
</A></FONT>

</H4>
Back in <A HREF="rtnv3n1.html#art10">RTNv3n1</A> I timed Craig Kolb's Rayshade, Mark Vandewettering's MTV, and
my own commercial code against each other.  Three years have passed and many
new ray tracers are out there.  I recently received from Eduard Schwan a
modified SPD package, with new code by Alexander Enzmann and him.  SPD stands
for Standard Procedural Databases, and is a set of programs I created for
testing ray tracer efficiency schemes (available at
<A HREF="ftp://princeton.edu/pub/Graphics/">princeton.edu:/pub/Graphics</A> and other places).  The modified code allows
output in formats other than NFF, such as POV, Vivid, RTrace, QRT, Rayshade,
etc.  I hope to modify this code a little and distribute it with the next SPD
release.  Since these new formats were now available, I decided to have a race
between the various ray tracers for just raw rendering speed.  I did not
bother with QRT because I couldn't easily find it on the net, it's pretty old,
and it does not have any efficiency speedups (so almost everything will beat
it).
<P>
I ran all tests on an HP 720 RISC workstation and compiled all ray tracers
with optimized and profiler options.  Instead of using Vivid, I used "Bob",
which is essentially Vivid and which had source code available (unlike Vivid,
I believe).  The source code is in _Photorealism and Ray Tracing in C_ (but
not on the net), reviewed elsewhere in this issue.  Rayshade runs fairly slow
if the user does not take any action to improve efficiency.  However, it is
simple enough to add a spatial subdivision grid to the input data.  I added a
grid of resolution == ceil( cube-root( # of primitives ) ) to each database,
but did not include the ground polygon (if present) to the grid.  POV 1.0 has
minimal efficiency support (user defined bounding boxes) which were too much
work to use, so I avoided these.  Vivid and RTrace both have automatic
efficiency schemes (the only way to go, in my humble opinion).  Vivid/Bob and
RTrace are descendents of MTV's efficiency scheme and use Kay-Kajiya space
sorting to get a bounding volume hierarchy.  Note that if you have Bob, you
should definitely get the errata from wuarchive at
graphics/graphics/books/errata, which has code which makes Bob 5% faster than
the original code.
<P>
Two sets of tests were done:  one with SPD using a size factor of 1, which
creates databases with from 4 to 147 primitives, the other with the default
size factors, which gives 4000 to 10,000 primitives.
<P>
Small, level 1 databases (from 4 to 147 primitives), times in seconds:

<P>
Notes:  Something screwy happened with converting cylinders for the rings
database for POV (this is probably the converter's fault, not POV's), so this
database did not render correctly.  The cones for the tree database seemed
weird at the ends, too, though they did render.  RTrace did not render the
teapot at size one as it (reasonably enough) balked when it encountered the
degenerate polygons with (0,0,0) normals.  These polygons have no area (so
can't be seen), but their data is indeed bad.
<P>
POV and ungridded Rayshade can be compared for raw object intersection speed;
Rayshade wins by 2x or more.  Adding the efficiency grid to Rayshade makes
performance increase by up to 6 times, even with these simple scenes (the
exception is tetra, which has only four primitives, and in which the grid
slows down performance).  Bob edges out RTrace by a little bit (maybe 20%),
and is sometimes better, sometimes worse than gridded Rayshade.  I should
mention that I ran Rayshade with all objects casting opaque shadows so as to
be comparable with POV (and Bob and RTrace, near as I can tell).  True
filtered shadows would take awhile longer to compute for the gears database.

</PRE>
<P>
Notes:  The POV times are approximate, made by extrapolating the time for an
8x8 pixel rendering minus the time for a 1x1 rendering (i.e.  minus file
read-in time).  The record for POV goes to gears, which would take about 3
weeks to render.  RTrace had a "runtime - too many SURFACES" on rings and so
did not render it.
<P>
If you were off the planet for the past decade and didn't think efficiency
schemes would gain you much, these timings would change your mind.  Since POV
1.0 doesn't have any efficiency scheme, its speed is a tad slow.  A good grid
makes Rayshade run like a speed demon, outperforming almost everything every
time.  Bob outperforms RTrace by a higher margin at this point.
<P>
Conclusions:  If you are willing to get your hands a little dirty with setting
up the gridding, use Rayshade (I hope Craig will make gridding default in the
next version).  For painless rendering, Bob/Vivid is good, though RTrace is in
the running and supports some interesting primitives and all sorts of other
support (see the Roundup in this issue).  POV is fun but slow.  The good news
is that version 2.0 of POV will have automatic efficiency generation and will
be out in a few months.  It will also fix a shading bug I noticed (strange
bright lines at the light silhouette edges of shiny spheres).  In the meantime
you can add bounding boxes by hand if you want (ugh) - it does make a
significant difference in speed.
<P>
If anyone else has filters for SPD output for ART or any other competitors,
please do pass them on to me and I'll give them a whirl.

Fast Triangle Intersection, part II, by John Spackman (<A HREF="mailto:spackman@lightwork.co.uk">spackman@lightwork.co.uk</A>)
</H4>
[This is in response to last issue's article by Chris Green, Steve Worley and
myself on half-plane testing for the inside-outside test for ray tracing
triangles.  John has a good illustration for what the barycentric coordinates
mean - EAH]

When the maths are boiled away, the barycentric test IS the half plane test -
with the extra advantage that the half plane 'heights' values are
normalised

<P>
Notice that 'alpha' is simply height above the 'alpha=0' half-space plane
             'beta' is simply height above the  'beta=0' half-space plane
            'gamma' is simply height above the 'gamma=0' half-space plane
<P>
     In effect, the triangle is simply the intersection of [0,1] slabs
in alpha, beta and gamma.
<P>
Of course, it is true that taking [alpha,beta,gamma] over a projected 2D
space may be faster than in full 3D space - but that's something else again.
<P>
[in a later note:]
With the Half-spaces you only get an early get-out if alpha &lt; 0.0.
<P>
With the Barycentric coordinates, you get an early get-out if alpha &lt; 0.0
                                                           OR alpha &gt; 1.0.
<P>
In other words, the former regards a triangle as an intersection of singly
bounded three half spaces, whereas the second regards a triangle as an
intersection of doubly bounded slabs.
<P>
________
<P>
John also points out:
<P>
But the half space test is just a homogeneous dot-product:-
<P>
<PRE>
        height = [x,y,z,1] . [s,t,u,v]
</PRE>
<P>
for the plane with outward normal [s,t,u] displaced at distance v from the
origin in this direction.
<P>
Therefore
<P>
<PRE>
        height = [x,y,z,1] . [s,t,u,v]
        -----    --------------------
        normalise       normalise

               = [x,y,z,1] . [s',t',u',v']

        where s' = s / normalise
              t' = t / normalise
              u' = u / normalise
              v' = v / normalise
</PRE>
<P>
is the same as the Barycentric test.
<P>
So just store [s',t',u',v'] instead of [s,t,u,v].  All normalisation is then
precomputed, the Barycentric test becomes as cheap as the half space test, and
the Limeys have saved the world again.
<P>
________
<P>
Eric Haines replies:
<P>
True that you get an early out with the bounding slab, and I thought this
would be a big win.  [I included a lot of statistics here, which basically
come up with the result that the two tests are pretty similar in performance
under a variety of conditions.  I will not bore you with the minutiae...
However, doing the precomputation is certainly a win, vs. using the straight
barycentric test (see <A HREF="rtnv5n3.html">RTNv5n3</A> for code).]
<P>
____
<P>
One interesting speedup that Steve Worley and I discussed for Chris Green's
method is sorting the edges of each triangle by its length.  Longer triangles
will tend to cut larger parts of the area of the bounding box surrounding the
triangle away, and so will cause earlier rejections of points outside the
triangle.  The long and short of it was that this trick indeed decreases
overall testing time in general and is simple to add to the preprocess for
creating triangle half-plane sets.  Steve points out that just getting the
longest edge first should help a fair bit and be an even faster preprocess,
though I did find that the full sort helped a tad more.
<P>
Sorting the two edges touching the anchor vertex for the Barycentric test
helps a bit, too.
<P>
Some interesting related sorting possibilities exist for convex polygon
testing.  If the triangle test is used, then the largest triangles should be
tested first in order to maximize the chance of an early hit.  If the exterior
edge test (test the point against all edges; if it is outside any edge then
you are done) is used then there is an optimal ordering of edges to test in
order to cut off the maximum amount of area per edge tested.  Getting this
optimal ordering looks like an NP-complete kind of a problem, though.  This is
pretty surprising, given that the problem appears fairly simple on the face of
it.

Review: _Photorealism and Ray Tracing in C_ (and others),
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines
</H4>
_Photorealism and Ray Tracing in C_ is by Christopher Watkins, Stephen Coy,
and Mark Finlay.  It's available through M&T Books in paperback and comes with
two PC 5 1/4" HD disks of code and data.  482 pages, 48 color plates, $44.95,
ISBN 1-55851-247-0.
<P>
This book discusses most facets of ray tracing with a hands on perspective.
There are many code fragments scattered throughout, along with a fully
functional ray tracer, Bob, which is a descendant of Vivid.  A simple modeler
and a back end to dither and display images on a PC are also provided.  Though
the code is PC oriented, I had very little difficulty compiling the ray tracer
on my UNIX workstation.  Not a lot of space of the book is devoted to PC
specific topics, maybe 40 pages.
<P>
The disks include polygon models for a human skull, an egyptian mummy head, a
human face, a heart, a duck, a column, Venus de Milo, some cars, chess pieces,
and other objects.  There are also a bunch of little programs which generate
various procedural models which are enjoyable in their own right.  Also
included are some texture maps.
<P>
The basics are covered along with some additional topics such as procedural
modeling, color and bump texturing, depth of field effects, soft shadows,
height fields, and others.  There is not much heavy theory presented, as the
book strives to teach the lone hobbyist or student without risking losing
them.  The color plates are a good mixture of educational and just for fun
images, and some of the renderings are excellent.  I believe the data to
render all of the plates is present on the disks.
<P>
There are a few shortcomings with the book.  One is common to many computer
paperbacks, that of listing pages and pages of uninterrupted code.  This book
is nowhere near the worst offender I've seen, but there are a fair number of
pages of code which have little reason for being on the printed page (e.g.
does anyone really want to read noise function code?).  Sampling every 20th
page (20,40,60...) of the book and seeing what was there, I found 11 out of
the 24 pages were code - a fairly high ratio.  This translates to about 220
pages of code.  Some is useful to publish, the rest is just bulk.
<P>
Another problem which is more serious is non-standard terminology.  The ones
I noticed:
    - height fields are referred to as "z-buffers".
    - the translation factors in a 4x4 matrix are presented in the first
        column, with W in the top row, instead of last row/column.
    - the function to transform normals, trans_normal(), works, but using the
        transpose of the inverse of the matrix would be faster and more
        readable.
An errata listing for this book is included elsewhere in this issue, and the
most current listing is kept at wuarchive.wustl.edu:graphics/graphics/books.
<P>
I was dismayed to see under "Where to Now?", a section at the very end of the
book, that the only books listed as places to go next were those sold by M&T
Books.  However, at least there were references to some related papers and
books (though beware of typoes) in the Bibliography.  There are some other
minor problems, but the book seems pretty solid otherwise.  Stephen Coy sent
me a list of corrections which I will try to edit up and get put in the
graphics book errata area at wuarchive.
<P>
If you wish to understand the basics of ray tracing and quickly get a ray
tracer going on your machine, consider getting this book.  Of the "disk in the
back" trade books out there, this one is reasonable in its approach and covers
a wide range of topics.  From what I can tell, it seems to be the best "with
code" book currently on the market.  BOB/VIVID is the fastest "free" (well,
you have to get the book if you want the source) ray tracer available today
(Rayshade datafiles can be tweaked to be made faster, but this involves
sometimes complicated user intervention).
<P>
There are a few other trade books on ray tracing.  Roger T. Stevens' _Fractal
Programming and Ray Tracing with C++_ is fairly old and nowhere near as good
(see <A HREF="rtnv4n2.html">RTNv4n2</A> for a brief, scathing review).
<P>
A book I have not had the opportunity to read (i.e. I don't want to fork
out $$$ for it...) is Craig Lindley's _Practical Ray Tracing in C_ (around
$49.95) from Wiley, which has a disk of software for DKB Trace, the ancestor
of POV.  What little I glanced at was not quite right.  For example, someone
pointed out his ray definition is a little odd.  Indeed, he says the "t" in
point = origin + t * direction stands for "time".  Not really, it's just a
parameter and it certainly does not stand for time (unless your name is
Ping-Kang Hsiung and you're doing relativistic ray tracing).
<P>
I also have not seen the book _The Image Lab_ from Waite Group Press, so
cannot say much about it.  This book is a collection of shareware/freeware
programs such as the POV ray tracer, the PICLAB image processing program,
CSHOW for viewing graphics files, IMPROCES super VGA paint program, and Image
Alchemy image converter (all of these programs can be found on the net).  It
seems unlikely that the book has much of a chance to go into any detail about
POV's basis given the number of programs included.  As an aside, Bob is faster
than the current POV 1.0 and does not show any serious rendering bugs (see the
timings test article in this issue).
<P>
For more advanced or textbook type material, there are a few good choices,
though none have any code provided with them.  _An Introduction to Ray
Tracing_ by Glassner et al (including myself) is a bit old but still a
comprehensive overview of the theory, though it is a little disjoint at times
and weak in some areas of interest (e.g.  texture mapping).  I should mention
this book is now in its fourth printing and all the typos and mistakes we know
about have been corrected.
<P>
Watt & Watt's new book, _Advanced Rendering and Animation Techniques:  Theory
and Practice_, is a good unified guide to advanced rendering in general and I
highly recommend it.  Think of it as a condensed and simplified "Best of
SIGGRAPH" for the past decade and you won't be too far wrong.  I hope to
review it next issue.
<P>
Foley and Van Dam and Feiner and Hughes' _Computer Graphics_ includes an
overview of ray tracing, if you don't feel like learning too much; other
recent textbooks also include summaries of the algorithms involved.

Comments on Various Ray Tracing Speedups,
</A></FONT>
by Andrew Woo (<A HREF="mailto:awoo@alias.com">awoo@alias.com</A>)
</H4>
With respect to Steve Worley's speedup idea with multiple grid orientations
["An Easily Implemented Ray Tracing Speedup", <A HREF="rtnv6n1.html">RTNv6n1</A>]
<P>
Our raytracer at Alias raytraces in eye-space (i.e. eye is at (0,0,0),
staring perpendicularly into the scene), Andrew Pearce did this to be
consistent with our non-raytrace renderers.  This requires an initial
transform of everything at the beginning (lights, geometry, etc).  However,
this has turned out to be quite advantageous for our raytracer.
<P>
Working in eye-space means that most of our primary rays will benefit from
Steve's multi-grid idea (i.e. most primary rays are almost in the grid
orientation).  According to Steve's assumption, working in eye-space is then
most idea for primary rays for orthographic cameras.  However, I have found
little performance increase with this - maybe because our raytracer already
has ray bounding boxes (ala Snyder & Barr, Siggraph 87) and the advantages
of Steve's approach have already been accounted for by the ray bounding boxes.
Maybe not, keep on hacking, Steve - interesting idea you have here.
<P>
Onto the bounding areas for ray-polygon intersection, by Steve Worley and
Eric Haines...  The general ray-polygon process that I find useful is very
similar to yours:
<P>
<PRE>
1) back-face culling (same as you suggested).
2) intersect with the polygon plane and determine a distance value T.  This
   evaluation is simply T = (d - N.O) / N.D, where N, d form the plane
   equation, O = ray origin, D = ray direction.
3) check that T &gt; epsilon and T &lt; an already hit polygon's T value.
4) check that the intersection point O + TD is inside the polygon bounding box.
5) perform the inside-outside test.
</PRE>
<P>
There is no need to intersect with the ray-intersect the polygon bounding box
- that's too expensive.  And I do step #4 with respect to the 3d polygon
bounding box because I already have those for the ray bounding box approach.
<P>
[This is actually identical to what I use.  Steve's 2D bounding test is just a
slightly faster way to do step #4 - since you can precompute once which plane
to cast the polygon upon, you can also precompute once which 2D box to use,
and you can combine the two (this is, of course, if you like longwinded,
duplicated code for speed - me, though I can see its use, I haven't
implemented the 2D test since it's just too much hacking).  - EAH]
<P>
Now here's the neat extension to eye-space raytracing (for perspective)
again...  Since the primary rays always have a ray origin at (0,0,0), the
evaluation of T just becomes d/N.D, and the intersection point is now just TD.
This can be advantageous for some traversal schemes as well (where O + TD
needs to be evaluated quite often).
<P>
I was also hacking with reducing the T evaluation for future generation rays.
I was able to reduce the floating point count, but found little improvement -
sigh.
<P>
Ok, I will stop shooting off my mouth and get some work done.

<P>
pg 157        Equation 6-1 is totally messed up.  Should be:
        REFL_DIR = RAY_DIR + 2*(RAY_DIR _dot_ NORMAL) * NORMAL
<P>
pg 164 "is simply to cast more than one ray per screen pixel (in other words,
        subsampling)."  should say "supersampling."

<P>
pg 168  Note that most of the samples have up= 0 0 1 not 0 1 0 and the "left"
        vector is calculated from up and the to and from points.
<P>
pg 168-169 Seems to imply that spherical projection differs from fisheye.  It
        doesn't.

<P>
        The patches for the code are attached at the end of this file.
        Tokens.c has a fix to correct a bug in the handling of numbers in
        scientific notation.  Inter.c has been optimized in a big way and
        gains an additional 5% overall for the raytracer.  Sponge.zip contains
        the correct version of the program to generate the sponge image in the
        book.
<P>
        Porting to a unix system is pretty trivial.  A makefile is needed, and
        little in the code needs to be changed.  The delimiter in file.c on
        line 70 may have to be modified.  The code uses &lt;string.h&gt;, so those
        using &lt;strings.h&gt; will have some macro defines ahead of them.

InterChange Plus Model/Texture Data CD-ROM,
</A></FONT>
by John Foust / Syndesis Corporation (<A HREF="mailto:76004.1763@compuserve.com">76004.1763@compuserve.com</A>)
</H4>
[Though a tad pricey, I thought this CD-ROM and software was of sufficient
interest to readers here to warrant publication.  Also, note the offer of
"free if you contribute to it".  The text is written by a representative of
the company but sounds reasonable.  BTW, I'm certainly interested in noting
any other commercial products out there that are related to ray tracing and
are affordable by mere mortals (i.e. less than $300 is a good target, less
than $100 even better) - EAH]
<P>
My company makes InterChange Plus, a system for translating between many
different 3D modeling file formats.  We've been in the Amiga market since
1987, but we're moving to Windows later this year.
<P>
The "Syndesis 3D-ROM" is a CDROM collection of more than 500 freely
distributable 3D models, all present in AutoCAD DXF, 3D Studio, Wavefront
.obj, Video Toaster LightWave and Impulse's Imagine PC/Amiga formats.  We
didn't attempt to fix the normals from objects that have random orientation.
(Since InterChange doesn't do that (yet) I didn't want to mislead people about
its abilities.)  It's also got more than 400 tileable, wrappable texture maps.
It includes a fully indexed, cross-referenced catalog of the objects.
<P>
The disc includes demonstration models from companies such as Viewpoint
Animation Engineering.  All 28 Viewpoint demo models are present, including
the yet-unreleased Siggraph 93 set.  More demo objects were contributed by
Noumenon Labs, VRS Media, Mira Imaging and other commercial modeling
companies.
<P>
The 3D-ROM is a demonstration of the translation abilities of InterChange
Plus, Syndesis's system for converting between 3D file formats.  InterChange
Plus translates between AutoCAD DXF, 3D Studio, Digital Arts, Wavefront,
Swivel, Sculpt, VideoScape, LightWave, Imagine, CAD-3D, PAGErender and Vista
DEM formats.  Soon to come is support for StereoLithography, Macromedia 3DGF,
Super 3D, Alias StyleGuide, Topas, Softimage, Inventor and Vertigo formats.
All material and hierarchy information is preserved as best as possible.  We
don't sell source, but we do license to several companies in executable form.
<P>
This ISO-9660 disc is fully accessible from MS-DOS, Macintosh, Amiga and Unix
workstations.  The price is $199.95.
<P>
If you'd like to find out about this CDROM, we'd be glad to add you
to our mailing list.  See us at Siggraph 93, booth 2244, Hall D.
<P>
We're not trying to get into the 3D object business, we're trying to tell
people about InterChange Plus, and to get more freely distributable objects
into the hands of artists.  We're going to make more editions of the 3D-ROM
with new objects.  In the newsletter, we'll describe how people can send us
objects and then get a free CDROM that contains their objects.  That's how
we're going to thank everyone who contributed.  I'd really like to flush out
all those nifty university-created and government-created data sets and
objects we're see over the years and convert them into useful, popular 3D
formats.
<P>
The Internet "avalon" site was kind enough to make me an 8mm Exabyte copy of
the 3D collection there, and I got the DEMs from the Xerox "spectrum" site.
Some of the avalon objects made it to the first disc, and more DEMs will be
present on future discs.

Ray Tracing Roundup
</A></FONT>
</H4>
There are a few things of note in ray tracing software out there.  Rayshade is
getting used more and more on workstations for "serious" rendering (as in
zillions and zillions of polygons, for example).  POV has a ton of people
cranking out utilities and whatnot.  RTrace does not seem to get the attention
it deserves (perhaps because of the sometimes hideous ftp connection to
Portugal - George Kyriazis, any chance of mirroring this site at wuarchive?).
It supports a good set of primitives and has a ton of converters to its format
(including some unique ones like IRIS Inventor, IRIT, etc) - see the RTrace
section below for a diagram of formats supported.
<P>

<P>
The site <A HREF="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu">wuarchive.wustl.edu</A> will soon mirror the entire net.  At least that
is how it's starting to look like - if you're having problems getting into
<A HREF="ftp://avalon.chinalake.navy.mil">avalon.chinalake.navy.mil</A> or find faramir.informatik.uni-oldenburg.de too far

For animation for any ray tracer, there is a utility called Animdat,
freeware/shareware that will replace variable names in a template file and
output a series of data files with the variables incremented in the right
places.  (<A HREF="mailto:hed@cats.ucsc.edu">hed@cats.ucsc.edu</A>)
<P>
There's also a very useful (and similar) package called RTAG.  It's a PC
binary only, though.  It is ASP software, $20, by P. Sherrod.  It supports
more functions, I believe, than Animdat such as spline curves for animation
paths.  (If Animdat currently supports splines, I apologize.  Last time I saw
it it didn't.)
<P>
It's worth a look if you have a PC and do animations with any of the popular
raytracers--the Rtag (and Animdat) packages aren't hard-coded to deal with
only POV.  I've uploaded it onto <A HREF="ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu">wuarchive.wustl.edu</A> (128.252.135.4) under

There is a new product for the IBM'ers out there.  It is called IMAGINE and it
just started shipping.  I can personally attest that it will blow the doors
off of 3D-Studio.  It is made by IMPULSE, and is in its 3rd version (1st for
the IBM).  It can do morphing, your standard key-framing animation, it is a
raytracer (reflections & shadows), and can do/apply special FX to objects
(like ripple, explode, bounce, things of that nature).  Also it has
algorithmic texture maps and your standard brushmapping also.
<P>
You can have animated brushmaps (i.e. live video mapped on the objs), also
animated backdrops (i.e. live video backgrounds), also animated reflections
maps.
<P>
Don't let the low price fool you, this product can do it all when it comes to
3D-animation and rendering!  (Tony R.  Boutwell, <A HREF="mailto:trb3@Ra.MsState.Edu">trb3@Ra.MsState.Edu</A>)
<P>
        I finally received the information about Imagine for the PC.  They are
presently shipping Version 2.0 of the software and will release Version 3.0 in
the first quarter of 1993 (or so they say).  The upgrade from 2.0 to 3.0 is
$100.00.  To purchase Imagine 2.0, it costs $495.00 or if you are upgrading
from another eligible (call them for info) modeler, it is only $200.00 plus
shipping & handling.  It requires a PC with 4 Megs, a math coprocessor, and
DOS 5.0 or up and a Microsoft mouse and SVGA card.  (Scott A Snowiss,
sasst11+@pitt.edu)
<P>
I work the same hours as Impulse so I had a friend call them for me.  They
told her the price was $495 but I could get it for $200 if I would send in a
photocopy of the manual cover from another ANIMATION program.  She asked them
what animation program would do?  They asked her which animation programs I
had.  She told them Deluxe Paint Animation and Disney's Animation Studio.
They said either one would do.  (Jim Nobles, <A HREF="mailto:usenet@ornl.gov">usenet@ornl.gov</A>)

I have placed the new rsdefs (v2.0) on weedeater.math.yale.edu in the incoming
directory.
<P>
Changes include new objects (chessboards; text characters (font.rh); rounded
boxes, cylinders, and discs; bathroom objects -- soap, soap-dish, drinking
glass, toothbrush, and glass holder; jewels), a better interface for using
objects and surfaces in scene files, and more example files.
<P>
For those who have never heard of the rsdefs package -- the package is a group
of files for use with rayshade that are #included into a scene file.  The
files define commonly used settings, constants, macros, surfaces and objects
inorder to make them commonly accessible to the user and to help reduce the
amount of work necessary for creating new scenes.
<P>
There are also several example files that show the use of the predefined
"creations" that also serve as general examples for the use of rayshade.
<P>
The "creations" have been defined so that they impart no extra overhead in the
way of memory to rayshade unless specifically invoked in a scene file.  The
creations only exist in the C-preprocessor's memory.
<P>
Objects and surfaces can be used either as instances or as named objects (the
"name" declaration for objects and "surface" declaration for surfaces).  The
objects can also be used inside aggregates (CSG, list, grid) and can be
followed by transformation calls that will transform the whole object.
<P>
Currently there are 57 surfaces, 184 superprimitives, 29 constants, viewing
parameters for several different output media and several macros and textures
defined.  (Larry Coffin, <A HREF="mailto:lcoffin@clciris.chem.umr.edu">lcoffin@clciris.chem.umr.edu</A>)

Joy over joy:  there's a new Inetray version out.  Apart from fixing a few
un-niceties it has one major advantage over version 1.0.1:  it can be used in
pipes and with stdin redirection.  This means that access to .ray files is no
longer necessary in the normal case.  Everything which is presented to inetray
on stdin is automatically sent to all worker machines.  That means that
something like this works:
<P>
$ echo "sphere 2 0 0 0" | inetray &gt; sphere.rle
<P>
Again, NO remote file access is required!!!
<P>
Inetray is an application allowing you to concurrently raytrace an image using
a lot of machines.  The task is dynamically distributed to all machines
offering this service.  Inetray is based on the Rayshade 4.0 libraries.  It
does not require any modification to the rayshade source and is compatible
with all patches (known to me).

used is 3556x3556 by 32 bit floats and an 8bit SAR radar image the same size
was texture mapped onto the surface.  This was done on a 4 headed SPARC 6/40
with 64Meg of RAM and a couple Gig of disk space, and took about 6 hours to
render at size of 2200 by 2800 pixels.  (David P. Anderson,

I have a new modeler out called Sculptura that you might want to try.  It has
Vivid and POV output, and it can read in DXF files, so you can use it to model
new shapes, or you can use it as a pathway for DXF to POV or Vivid.  There is
a demo version at <A HREF="ftp://wuarcive.wustl.edu">wuarcive.wustl.edu</A> in /mirrors /mirrors/win3/demo/demo3d.zip

I wrote a PM (for IBM's OS/2) interface for DKB.  The file is dkbpm.zip or
dkbpm2.zip and is available at hobbes.nmsu.edu, in a graphics directory
somewhere, sorry I can't remember the exact path.  It has a statistics window
with time stats, a bitmap image viewing window and a transcript window for
progress reporting.  Menus and dialogs to set all the options.  Source is also
included.
<P>
I'm working on the next release of POV for PM and NT.  The beta I have for
OS/2 is pretty similar to the DKB version.  The NT beta I have has a
quantization thread that constantly quantizes the image and adjusts the
palette accordingly.  It also can launch multiple render threads if you have a
multiprocessor NT machine.  I'm in the process of migrating the quant and
palette stuff back to OS/2.  I'll let you know when povpm and povnt are
available.  (Michael Caldwell, <A HREF="mailto:mcaldwel@netcom.com">mcaldwel@netcom.com</A>)

I gave up on the Transputers -- sent 'em back -- and am now building a new
parallel processor based on 386 motherboards.  Cheaper, better performance,
easier to port software.  Plus, in a pinch, if I get lazy, I could just run
Win4Workgroups or NT on each of 'em and get no-code concurrent
multiprocessing.  For now, though, I'm still trying the harder way -- i.e.
modifying PoVRay code to optimize for parallel execution.

One of the best utilities I've found for POV it called SP - Dave's Spline-
Path Generator.  You can find this on the You Can Call Me Ray BBS.  Basically,
you make a data file of a number of points and some other information, and SP
will calculate position and rotations for your camera.  You can do
acceleration/deceleration, etc...  with it as well.  Its downfall (at least as
of version 0.3) is that it only does one frame at a time (you tell it which of
the N frames to compute).  It's relatively easy to make a batch file for this,
though.  (Jason Barile, <A HREF="mailto:barilejb@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu">barilejb@ctrvax.vanderbilt.edu</A>)

I produce POV 3D fonts and have a range of about 500 so far.  Price is about
65 UK pounds or 90 for two.  The data is about 3-4 meg uncompressed for each
font and each letter has to be #included and assigned a texture, details and
examples are included with the font.  The level of detail is very high, and
looks good even when flying through the bowl of a "P" for example.  I decided
on a standard where the baseline of the font is at zero, with the leading
height at 1, with the font being 1 unit deep.  This makes changing fonts
easier, though still a little fiddly adjusting kerning...  There is as yet no
easy way of making them - the process takes several hours of hard work with
W4W macros.  Available in Vivid format too.  (Andrew Haveland-Robinson,

There is a new version of the RTrace ray-tracing package (8.2.0) at
<A HREF="ftp://asterix.inescn.pt">asterix.inescn.pt</A> [192.35.246.17] in directory pub/RTrace.  Check the README

The MAC RTrace 1.0 port is in directory pub/RTrace/Macintosh Thanks to Reid
Judd (reid.judd@east.sun.com) and Greg Ferrar
(<A HREF="mailto:gregt@function.mps.ohio-state.edu">gregt@function.mps.ohio-state.edu</A>).
<P>
For all the Mac users of RTrace, there is a Compact-Pro HQX file called
movies.cpt.hqx in pub/RTrace/Macintosh, at asterix.inescn.pt [192.35.246.17].
In this file I've put 2 small animations to be played with SimplePlayer or any
similar program (in the Mac, of course).
<P>
For all the users of RTrace, there is a specification of the format RTrace
uses in a Postscript compressed file called sffv8.ps.Z.  [SFF is something
like NFF, vastly extended to handle splines, textures, etc.  - EAH]
<P>
There is also a 3D Studio 1.0 file converter in pub/RTrace/scene-conv called
3ds2scn.awk.  You must have a reasonably good AWK program (preferably gawk
2.14) to process the ASCII files that 3D Studio creates and convert them to
SCN format.

RTrace now can use the SUIT toolkit to have a nice user interface.  Compile it
with -DSUIT or modify the Makefile.  SUIT is available at
