First, the Ray Tracing Roundtable (which is essentially a schmooze-fest for
graphics programmers) will be on Thursday at SIGGRAPH at the Peabody Hotel
(across the street from the convention center) in Bayhill Rooms I &amp; II from
6:15 to 7:45 pm. This is the dead time between when papers and panels end and
when the reception starts. Usual about 50 people gather, introduce
themselves, then break up and talk until time's up.
<P>
An extremely cool idea was implemented at the Java One conference this year
[thanks to John Foust for passing on a report about it]. The Java Rings given
to attendees each held a microprocessor which ran a Java VM.  Here's a quote
from <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/features/1998/03/rings.html">http://java.sun.com/features/1998/03/rings.html</A> (go there for images and
more info):
<P>
&quot;Another applet on the ring calculated pixel values for a 3x3 tile that would
contribute to a large fractal image being computed by Java Rings throughout
the show. Each time an attendee would snap a ring into a reader, the
calculated pixel values would be loaded onto a server collecting tiles to
form a kind of fractal &quot;quilt.&quot; The corresponding host application on the
server would display the aggregate image throughout the conference, allowing
people to watch the fractal grow.&quot;
<P>
I know another graphics application that's extremely parallelizable and the
code can fit on a business card... It would be a challenge to see if there's
enough room on a ring for ray tracing a procedural model. Really, for each
ring, 9 pixels of a fractal image were probably computed in less than a
second. A nice compact and complex database would be an interesting
application. 4K *bits* of memory is not a lot, but it would be fun to try.
There are 20 million of these processors deployed by the manufacturer (many
on the ears of cows and whatnot). &quot;Yep, this barn here produces 5000 gallons
and traces 10 million rays a day...&quot;
<P>
On another front, one of the more interesting sites I've come across is
<A HREF="http://www.cut-the-knot.com">http://www.cut-the-knot.com</A>. It's a pleasant collection of mathematical
recreations with java applets helping to explain various phenomena and
theorems. I particularly love the shapes of constant width page:
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.cut-the-knot.com/do_you_know/cwidth.html">http://www.cut-the-knot.com/do_you_know/cwidth.html</A>
<P>
Java with a purpose, used instructively and non-obtrusively.
<P>
This issue has a bias towards geometric operations. I'm privileged to present
Ken Shoemake's tutorial on Pl&uuml;cker coordinates (not available anywhere
else). There is also material on shrinking polygons and correcting surface
normals. This issue also contains a huge roundup of links to resources. Some
amazing things are in there, one of my favorites being the Hungarian model
converter that almost no one's heard of, but that converts 90+ file formats.
<P>
In the next issue there will be a lot of interesting tidbits from various
people, including new SPD timings. In terms of just plain speed, Sami Perttu
tried Rayshade 4.0 with lots of tuned compiler options in gcc and Linux 2.0
and rendered the Sphereflake in 79 seconds on a 200 MHz Pentium.  John Stone
has been designing and implementing a parallel processing ray tracer that is
extremely fast.  He told me Sphereflake on a 4 processor DEC Alpha ran in 4.5
seconds.  And on a 50 processor SGI Origin2000 at NCSA it ran in 1.5 seconds.
The previous record (that I'm aware of) was 16 seconds, set by the AT&amp;T Pixel
Machine in 1988.  I'm not sure what to be more amazed by, John's time (I
recall back when it took me hours to render Sphereflake) or Sami's (a Pentium
is one fifth the speed of the Pixel Machine at less than one hundredth the
price). &quot;If cars were computers, they'd now get 10,000 miles a gallon, go 6,000
miles per hour, and cost $5&quot; and all that (of course, they'd also inexplicably
blow up once a year, killing all occupants).

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/">http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~algorith/</A>
<P>
The author of the site - Steven Skiena - has a book The Algorithm Design
Manual that I bought down at the UW bookstore.  It's great to page through
when you're noodling on a problem and trying to break it down and see if
other's have solved it in an efficient way.  It's the first good book I've
seen devoted to a practical application of over 75 classic algorithms (vs.
the mathematical analysis and proof of correctness of algorithms).
<P>
The book comes with a CD that contains an entire HTML version of the book
completely hyperlinked for cross-references and searchable.  The CD also has
over 30 hours of audio lectures in real-audio format complete with HTML
lecture notes for an entire semester course on algorithms.  The author did
this for a course at SUNY and tossed it in.

<A NAME="renderingwithradiance">
<B>_Rendering with Radiance_ book</B></A>
<P>
Greg Ward Larson and Rob Shakespeare (publisher: Morgan Kaufmann) have
written a detailed and well-produced book on the use and algorithms behind
the Radiance rendering system (<A HREF="http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/">http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/</A>).  Code,
examples, documentation and more are included on a CD-ROM in the book.  In
case you hadn't heard, Radiance is an amazing free software system for
physically accurate lighting design.  The book starts with tutorials, then
discusses different sorts of applications (lighting analysis, daylight
simulation, stage lighting, etc.) and ends with 120 pages on calculation
methods.  These last chapters cover the system in much more depth than Greg
Ward's original SIGGRAPH '88 paper, as well as discuss possible errors,
extensions, and other developments since that time.  The Table of Contents is
available at:

<B>The Geometry Toolbox</B></A>
<P>
Authored by Gerald Farin and Dianne Hansford (A.K. Peters, Ltd.), this book
looks to be useful for teaching analytic geometry for computer graphics. What
is appealing to me is the copious use of illustrations to build an intuition
about what the various operations actually do. Two sample chapters, along
with the table of contents and index, are available online at:

<P>
This is a book I am definitely getting at SIGGRAPH. How can you turn down a
book with a section called &quot;Eigen Things&quot;?  Seriously, skimming the sample
chapters, it looks to be a good combination of solid equations and
explanatory text and illustrations, perfect for computer graphics programmers.

<B>Rayshade on Linux and Windows98</B>

I have an unofficial Linux port of Rayshade.  I have tested it under
Linux(gcc) and Windows98(msvc++).  It works under both of those platforms,
but I am not certain that it will function under the platforms on which it
has traditionally been used.
<P>
The majority of the porting effort was converting the old-style 'Configure'
script to the newer style gnu 'configure' script generated by 'autoconf'.  If
you are interested in it, I would appreciate feedback as to whether or not it
still works under the platforms on which it was traditionally used.

For those who are interested, my thesis is now available online:
<P>
Robust Monte Carlo Methods for Light Transport Simulation, Eric Veach, Ph.D.
dissertation, Stanford University, December 1997
<P>
<A HREF="http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis/">http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/veach_thesis/</A>
<P>
It describes techniques such as Metropolis light transport, multiple
importance sampling, and bidirectional path tracing in more detail than in
the corresponding papers.  It also includes quite a bit of new material,
including studies of:
<P>
<PRE>
  - the inherent limitations of unbiased Monte Carlo methods
  - new variance reduction techniques
  - the history of reciprocity principles and important exceptions to them
  - the derivation of a new reciprocity principle that applies to materials
    that transmit as well as reflect light  [i.e. BTDF's as well as BRDF's]
</PRE>

You can find the abstract and table of contents on the web page, as well as
Postscript and PDF versions of the thesis.

POVRay Ring is a group of sites dedicated to POVRay: image galleries, file
archives, tutorials, &quot;howto's&quot;, project info, source code patches and more,
but always related in some way or another to POVRay. Currently there are over
75 sites, and more to come, so if you are looking for something about POVRay,
you should check the ring, maybe it is there (faster than other ways of
searching). If you have a page that meet the requirements, it is really easy
to join (and free), fill out a form and put some HTML code in the page. To
keep the sites joined we use the services of WebRing.

<P>
The language looks a bit intimidating to learn, but the program's pretty
accessible: just start up WFORM (&quot;WFORM -res2&quot; is better on faster machines,
more screen space), open a .FRM file from the SHAPES or OTHERS directories,
and hit &quot;Go!&quot;. If the shape looks interesting, go to &quot;MutateMode!&quot; and hit
&quot;Go!&quot; again. The shape is used to produce 3 offspring, a la Todd and Latham.
Double click on an offspring (or the parent again), and you get more
offspring from that. I *think* if you set the Mutation Settings under File to
a lower value you get less variation. Pretty fun and quick to start using.
<P>
To actually save your creation you seem to have to do a little two-step: save
it out as <A HREF="ftp://filename.frm">filename.frm</A>, then run &quot;FORM -vrml filename.frm&quot; and the file
<A HREF="ftp://temp.wrl">temp.wrl</A> is output. Drop this in your browser and there it is.

generate lower polygon count level of detail versions of the model. If you
combine this utility with Keith Rule's Crossroads 3D file translator at
<A HREF="http://www.europa.com/~keithr/">http://www.europa.com/~keithr/</A> (which reads and writes VRML 1.0), you have a
nice poor-man's polygonal model simplifier for any format that Crossroads can
write (which is quite a few at this point).

Pl&uuml;cker Coordinate Tutorial</A></FONT>, by Ken Shoemake (<A HREF="mailto:ks@emanon.net">ks@emanon.net</A>)
</H4>
Pl&uuml;cker 3D line coordinates are concise and efficient for numerous chores.
Dot products and cross products reveal their geometry, without the need for
determinants. For the impatient (and aren't we all a little?), results come
first, then explanations.
<P>
On notation: Frequently 3D graphics uses a 3-tuple, (x,y,z), without concern
for whether it represents a vector or a point. When being more careful, (U:0)
will be the homogeneous coordinates of vector U, with U = (Ux,Uy,Uz), and
(P:1) -- or (P:w) -- the homogeneous coordinates of point P, with P =
(Px,Py,Pz). The origin is then (O:1), with O = (0,0,0), and subtracting it
from a point creates a vector. The cross product PxQ is the 3-tuple
(PyQz-PzQy,PzQx-PxQz,PxQy-PyQx), and the dot product U.V is the number
UxVx+UyVy+UzVz. A direction is a vector with length ignored. A plane has
equation ax+by+cz+dw = 0, or D.P+dw = 0, so its coordinates are [a:b:c:d], or
[D:d], with D = (a,b,c) perpendicular to the plane. Planes [D:0] contain the
origin. Colon (&quot;:&quot;) rather than comma (&quot;,&quot;) proclaims homogeneity.
<P>

Note: E.U = 0 if U is a direction vector in plane [E:e]. If P is in the
plane, so is P+U.
<P>
Warning: In reality, line intersections, parallelism, and various other
alignments have vanishingly small probability. Small perturbations destroy
them, and so numerical tests may need the robustness of error bounds.
<P>
Now we pause a minute to let the cookbook crowd rush off to write code. The
overachievers may want to drift off to prove everything for themselves. All
gone? Then the rest of us can try to build a little intuition, so as to
understand the results.
<P>
The standard determinant definition of Pl&uuml;cker 3D line coordinates takes two
distinct points on line L, call them P and Q, written homogeneously in two
columns as follows:
<PRE>
  [Px Qx] row x
  [Py Qy] row y
  [Pz Qz] row z
  [Pw Qw] row w
</PRE>
Make all possible determinants of pairs of rows. Only six combinations are
independent; these are the Pl&uuml;cker coordinates. See geometry yet? Probably
not. But set the w's to 1, and look again.
<P>
Rows x and w (in that order) give Px-Qx. Also rows y and w give Py-Qy, and
rows z and w give Pz-Qz. So define U = P-Q. That's half the Pl&uuml;cker
coordinates. Rows y and z give PyQz-PzQy. Hmm, look familiar? Sure enough,
rows z and x, and rows x and y, also give cross product components. So we
define V = PxQ as the other half of the Pl&uuml;cker coordinates. Using L = {U:V}
= {P-Q:PxQ} we can think geometrically, not algebraically.
<P>
<PRE>
  Example: P = (2,3,7), Q = (2,1,0). Then L = {U:V} = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4}.
</PRE>
<P>
We just use familiar properties of dot products and cross products. The dot
product of any two vectors A and B is 0 just when they are perpendicular, and
the cross product of A and B is a vector that always is perpendicular to both
A and B (or is null). The squared length of A is A.A, and A.B = B.A. In
contrast, AxB = -BxA, implying AxA = (0,0,0). Thus AxB nulls any component of
B parallel to A, and rotates the rest of B 90 degrees. When A and B are
perpendicular and of unit length, this implies Bx(AxB) = A = (BxA)xB. Both
dot and cross products distribute over sums and scales, so A.(aB1+bB2) =
a(A.B1)+b(A.B2) and (aA1+bA2)xB = a(A1xB)+b(A2xB), for example.
<P>
Now clearly U = P-Q gives the direction of the line; and V = PxQ (if it's
non-null) is perpendicular to the plane through P, Q, and the origin. Less
obviously, the colon is there because moving P and/or Q scales U and V
together. Think about it. We know P = U+Q, with U some multiple of a fixed
unit vector. But then V = PxQ = (U+Q)xQ = UxQ, so moving P clearly scales V
the same as U. All variation in Q also comes from adding multiples of U to
the point T where a vector from the origin meets the line perpendicularly; in
other words Q = sU+T. But that means V = UxQ = Ux(sU+T) = UxT, and T is a
fixed point of L that does not depend on P or Q. So if either P or Q moves,
the length of U changes, and with it the length of V, by the same scale
factor. Clearly we can also generate coordinates directly from a ray
representation, (U,Q), a direction and a point. We know that U is the
direction of L, which we can normalize; then the length of V gives the
minimum distance from L to the origin, ||T||, and so (T.T) = (V.V)/(U.U).
<P>
<PRE>
  Example. P = (2,3,7), Q = (2,-1,-7). Then {U:V} = {0:4:14:-14:28:-8}.
           Squared distance from origin is 261/53.
  Example. U = (2,1,0), Q = (2,1,0). Then {U:V} = {2:1:0:0:0:0}.
           Squared distance from origin is 0.
</PRE>
<P>
Since a line is uniquely determined by its direction and its vector
displacement from the origin, there is a one to one correspondence between
lines and Pl&uuml;cker coordinates. Lines in 3D have four degrees of freedom, but
the {U:V} pair has six numbers. Obviously homogeneity accounts for one
freedom. The second comes from the fact that U.V = 0, so not all pairs are
valid lines. Nevertheless, two lines are distinct if and only if their
Pl&uuml;cker coordinates are linearly independent. That is, the test for equality
is like that for points given as homogeneous coordinates.
<P>
<PRE>
  Example. {0:2:7:-7:14:-4} is the same line as {0:4:14:-14:28:-8}.
  Example. {0:2:7:-7:14:-4} is not the same line as {2:1:0:0:0:0}.
</PRE>
<P>
Now still thinking geometrically, look at dual coordinates, defined from two
plane equations of the form ax+by+cz+dw = 0, namely E.P + e = 0 and F.P + f =
0. We know that as vectors E and F are perpendicular to their respective
planes. Clearly ExF, being perpendicular to both, must be the direction of L,
their intersection. Any point P on L satisfies both equations, and also
satisfies the linear combination (fE-eF).P = 0. Thus the vector fE-eF defines
a plane through the origin that contains L. So miraculously, it turns out
that {U:V} = {ExF:fE-eF}. Assuming neither defining plane passes through the
origin, we can normalize so e and f are 1, and the duality is {P-Q:PxQ} =
{ExF:E-F}.
<P>
<PRE>
  Example. [E:e] = [1:0:0:-2] and [F:f] = [0:7:-2:-7]. Then {U:V} =
        {0:2:7:-7:14:-4}.
</PRE>
<P>
The striking similarity of the point and plane definitions tell us Pl&uuml;cker
3D line coordinates precisely balance these extremes. Many computational
benefits accrue. Also, many questions come in dual pairs, with the answers
for one obtained by swapping U and V in the answers for the other.
<P>
We know, for example, that [V:0] is an origin plane through L (if V is not
null), and that (U:0) is a vector in the direction of L, each unique. The
point T = (VxU:U.U) of L is perpendicular to (U:0), meaning T.U = 0, because
V = UxT, so VxU = (U.U)T. Dually, the plane [UxV:V.V] through L is
perpendicular to plane [V:0].
<P>
<PRE>
  Example. {U:V} = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4}. Then T = (-106:49:14:53) is point
        closest to origin.
            Plane perpendicular to [V:0] is [106:-49:-14:261].
</PRE>
<P>
What point do L and a given plane [N:n] have in common? Consider first an
origin plane, [N:0]. It meets the [V:0] plane in a line of points (VxN:w),
and to meet the [UxV:V.V] plane w must satisfy w(V.V) = (VxU).(VxN) =
(V.V)(U.N). Therefore the common point is (VxN:U.N) when n is 0, or
(VxN-nU:U.N) in general. Dually, the plane that L has in common with a given
point (P:w) is [UxP-wV:V.P]. For a vector (N:0), this is [UxN:V.N].
<P>
<PRE>
  Example. {U:V} = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4} and [N:n] = [0:0:1:0]. Intersection is
        (14:7:0:7).
           [N:n] = [0:0:1:-7]. Intersection is (14:21:49:7).
           (P:w) = (2:0:0:1). Common plane is [7:0:0:-14].
           (N:0) = (1:1:1:0). Common plane is [-5:7:-2:3].
</PRE>
<P>
These are important results, so let's take it again more slowly. The vector
(VxN:0) is perpendicular to both V and N, as is any scalar multiple,
(VxN:0)/w. Since [N:0] and [V:0] both contain the origin, (O:1), they also
contain point O + VxN/w, which scales by w to give (VxN:w) in homogeneous
form. Now a point (P:w) lies in plane [UxV:V.V] if it satisfies the equation
(UxV).P+(V.V)w = 0. Noting UxV = -VxU, this is w(V.V) = (VxU).P.
Substituting, the point we want satisfies w(V.V) = (VxU).(VxN). We deduce w =
U.N by showing (VxU).(VxN) = (V.V)(U.N). The cross product with V rotates and
scales plane [V:0], which contains U, and nulls any component of N parallel
to V. Since the latter contributes nothing to the dot product with U, we have
our desired result. If V is null, (VxN:U.N) is still a point of intersection,
the origin. However when the line and plane are parallel, they either
intersect everywhere or nowhere, and the formula fails.
<P>
From these few formulae we can produce a number of other useful results. To
transform a line by a matrix without perspective, we first convert the line
to (direction,point) form, transform that pair, then convert the result back
to Pl&uuml;cker form. For this and other reasons we want the quickest way to find
a point on L = {U:V}. For example, this also gives the necessary data to
determine if L lies in a given plane. Notice that we can easily generate
more, using U. (This is necessary to apply transforms with perspective, which
require a pair of points.) But (VxN:U.N) gives points on L, and choosing N
cleverly will avoid multiplies. Merely find a non-zero component of U, and
let N be a unit vector in that direction.
<P>
<PRE>
  Example. {U:V} = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4}. Take N = (0,1,0), giving point
        (4:0:-7:2) on line.
            Plane [1:0:0:1] does not contain the point, so it does not
                contain the line.
            It does contain direction [0:2:7:0], so is parallel to the line.
</PRE>
<P>
To test if a point P is on L, we should use two independent plane equations.
The obvious idea is to dualize what we just did using [V:0] and [UxN:V.N],
with N a unit vector in the direction of a non-zero component of V. Yet this
may fail. We always have a non-null U, but lines through the origin give a
null V. Still, we can work with what we have. Let N, N1, and N2 be unit
vectors for the three coordinate axes, with N in the direction of a non-zero
component of, not V, but U. Then N1 and N2 give two suitable planes,
[UxN1:V.N1] and [UxN2:V.N2].
<P>
<PRE>
  Example. {U:V} = {2:1:0:0:0:0}. Take N = (1,0,0), N1 = (0,1,0), N2 = (0,0,1),
        giving planes [0:0:2:0] and [1:-2:0:0] through line.
            Point (2:3:0:1) lies only in the second plane, so is not on the
                line.
</PRE>
<P>
Every point on L is a weighted sum of (U:0) and (VxU:U.U), so a parametric
equation for all points on L is Pnt(t) = (VxU+tU:U.U). Dually, a parametric
form for planes through L is Pln(t) = (1-t^2)[UxN1:V.N1]+2t[UxN2:V.N2], a
weighted combination of the two planes we learned how to generate a moment
ago. This latter pair of weights, 1-t^2 and 2t, is perhaps overly elaborate,
but chosen as points on a rationally parameterized circle (x:y:w) =
(1-t^2:2t:1+t^2). Any way to get all possible ratios of weights will do.
<P>
<PRE>
  Example. {U:V} = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4}. Pnt(t) = (-106:49+2t:14+7t:53).
  Example. {U:V} = {2:1:0:0:0:0}. Pln(t) = [2t:-4t:2(1-t^2):0].
</PRE>
<P>
If two lines intersect, they are coplanar. This latter condition we can test
as follows. Suppose L1 = {U1:V1} and L2 = {U2:V2}. The common plane
containing both L1 and U2 is [U1xU2:V1.U2], while that containing L2 and U1
is [U2xU1:V2.U1]. Since U1xU2 = -U2xU1, coplanarity demands U1.V2 + U2.V1 =
0. When the two lines are parallel, U1 and U2 give the same direction and the
plane formulae are invalid, yet the test still works.
<P>
If we want a formula for a common plane even so, we can try a linear
combination of V1 and V2 for the normal, since both are perpendicular to the
common direction. Find a non-zero component of U1, and let N be a unit vector
in that direction; then if V1 and V2 are not both null, use
[(U1.N)V2-(U2.N)V1:(V1xV2).N]. Otherwise L1 and L2 are not only parallel, but
identical, and pass through the origin; generate a plane for L1 using the
standard method. Perhaps the reader can devise a uniform method for
generating a common plane, however small perturbations generally have large
consequences for this situation.
<P>
We cannot hope to find a point of intersection for parallel lines, but
otherwise a suitable formula is actually the dual,
((V1.N)U2-(V2.N)U1-(V1.U2)N:(U1xU2).N), where N is a unit axis vector
independent of U1 and U2. This is less computation than its size suggests. It
can be derived as the plane through L2 in the direction N, [U2xN:V2.N],
intersected with L1, (V1x(U2xN)-U1(V2.N):U1.(U2xN)), followed by two cross
product identities, Ax(BxC) = (A.C)B-(A.B)C, and A.(BxC) = (AxB).C. When
neither V1 nor V2 is null, the far simpler formula [V1xV2:U1.V2] will
suffice; it is the dual of the common plane [U1xU2:V1.U2].
<P>
<PRE>
  Example. L1 = {0:2:7:-7:14:-4} and L2 = {2:1:0:0:0:0} are coplanar.
            Lines are not parallel.
            Common plane is [-7:14:-4:0].
            Taking N = (1,0,0), intersection point is (-14:-7:0:-7).
</PRE>
<P>
Tempting as this geometric development is, it conceals the generality of the
algebra. Pl&uuml;cker 3D line coordinates are only one special case (albeit a
very useful one) of Grassmann coordinates.
<P>
Using Grassmann coordinates we can uniformly manage points, lines, planes,
and such (generically, flats) in spaces of any dimension. We can generate
them, intersect them, and so on, with simple equations. There are fewer
special cases, such as lines given by two points versus point and direction.
Three planes through a point or three points on a plane (in 3D) use the same
algebra as two planes through a line.

A Short Note on Kalra and Barr's Algorithm</A></FONT>, by Andrei Sherstyuk (<A HREF="mailto:ash@cs.monash.edu.au">ash@cs.monash.edu.au</A>)
</H4>
This message is intended for folks who might be interested in implementing
this algorithm. The algorithm was published as &quot;Guaranteed Ray Intersection
with Implicit Surfaces&quot;, in SIGGRAPH '89 proceedings, pp. 297-306.
<P>
Kalra and Barr's algorithm has been around for almost 10 years and gained a
good reputation among implicitly-minded ray-tracing people. Still, I could
not find a public-domain ray-tracer that implemented this algorithm. So I had
to write it from scratch.
<P>
En route, I found a typo in the math appendix of the paper, apparently
introduced during typesetting.  In the paper, there is a brief description
how to compute L and G for Gaussian potentials, aka Blinn's blobs:
<P>
<PRE>
    f(r) = B exp {-A r^2},
</PRE>
<P>
where r^2 is a squared distance to the center of the blob. (page 305).
<P>
I did not check the computations of L (the Lipschitz constant for the
functions itself). However, computations of G must be corrected in the
following way: the 2nd directional derivative h(t) is given as:
<P>
<PRE>
    h = -2.0*AB*exp(-A*r2)*(k1 - A*(k2 + t*k1)*(k2 + t*k1));
</PRE>
<P>
The correct expression is:
<P>
<PRE>
    h = -2.0*AB*exp(-A*r2)*(k1 - 2.0*A*(k2 + t*k1)*(k2 + t*k1));
                                 ^^^
</PRE>
<P>
The result of this typo is that the G-values for each blob come out smaller
than they really are. This may cause the algorithm to underestimate the rate
of change of the field function and start closing on the root in the interval
where the function is NOT monotonic.
<P>
In principle, this could cause divergence (if Newton's method is used) or the
first intersection may be missed (if regular falsi is used, which may
converge to the second root).
<P>
In practice, with all datasets that I tried this bug does not surface. The
reason is the following: the collective G-value for a sum of several blobs is
calculated as a sum of G-values computed for individuals blobs. This is a
very conservative result.  In a way, the algorithm is very self-protective
and always sets the safety limits basing on the worst-case behavior of the
collective field function, which in practice (almost) never happens.
Therefore, a little loosening of G only helps the speed at the expense of
safety.
<P>
However, since so much math is involved already, it makes sense to do it by
the rules, which makes the algorithm absolutely reliable.
<P>
To finish, the plot of h(t) (Figure 21) should be viewed upside-down. This
minor inconvenience is not really important for the algorithm, but also
should be corrected to obtain peace of mind after all these troubles.

From page 49:
<P>
&quot;Here is an alternative method for computing the winding number, suggested by
Poincare himself. Instead of keeping track of the vector V(P) as P traverses
the path 'gamma', we watch just one particular direction of our choosing and
record only the times that the vector P points in that direction.  If the
vector V(P) passes through the direction going counterclockwise, we count
plus one; if it passes through the direction going clockwise, we count minus
one; and we count zero if the vector only comes up to our chosen direction
and then retreates [sic] back the way it came. For the distinguished
direction we choose due north.&quot;
<P>
[Neil is working on an algorithm similar to the one in Section 2 of the paper
&quot;Ray Tracing Trimmed Rational Surface Patches&quot;, by Nishita, Sederberg, and
Kakimoto, Computer Graphics (24), No. 4, Aug. 1990, 337-345. The clever bit
of these curve algorithms is the use of convex hulls around the curves. For
example, with a test ray pointing north, if you know that your test point is
south of the convex hull and you know that one endpoint of the curve is west
of the ray and one is east, then you know the ray crosses the curve an odd
number of times. This is all you need for an inside-outside test - you do not
have to compute the actual intersection. Similarly, if both endpoints of a
curve are to one side of the ray, you know the ray hits the curve an even
number of times. -EAH]

Info on REYES Algorithm</A></FONT>, by Robert Speranza and Tom Duff (<A HREF="mailto:td@pixar.com">td@pixar.com</A>)
</H4>
Robert Speranza wrote on comp.graphics.rendering.renderman:
<P>
Basically, the REYES algorithm involves taking the rendering geometry and
dicing up into micropolygons that are less than one pixel in size in screen
space and then shading them.  Once they are all shaded (which usually
involves sampling their midpoints because they are so small that they are at
the Nyquist limit for the display device), a filter is applied to antialias
the resulting values into the pixels you see in the final image.  This is
performed for each scan line which is why PRMan does not raytrace.  This
technique does not mix well with raytracing since micropolygons are discarded
as each scanline is rendered.
<P>
____
<P>
Tom Duff replied:
<P>
Almost.
<P>
A better (certainly more long-winded) summary might be:
<P>
1) Divide the screen into smallish (typically 4x4 or 16x16 pixel)
   rectangular buckets.  (Bucketing is done just for
   memory saving &amp; is not essential to the algorithm.)
<P>
2) Read geometry into the bucket list.  An important feature of Reyes
   is that the geometry it renders need not be just polygons, but can
   also be higher-order curved surfaces like quadrics, NURBS and Catmull-Clark
   subdivision surfaces.  Each primitive is stored with the first bucket
   to be processed in which it appears (actually, *might*
   appear, based on bounds that could be too conservative.)
<P>
3) Loop through the buckets, examining all the geometric primitives.
   Primitives that fail a screen-space flatness test are subdivided
   and the pieces rebucketed.  Those passing the test are diced into grids
   of micropolygons, which are shaded.  The intent is that micropolygons be
   so small that their shape is not discernable in the final image.  Typically
   this means that their edges are about 1/2 the pixel spacing.  The shading
   system is fully programmable, and interprets shaders in a SIMD manner,
   running on all points in the grid simultaneously.  The three important
   features of this scheme are that interpreter overhead is amortized over
   many micropolygons, that values of all variables and interpreter
   temporaries are available at all points on the grid, allowing the
   interpreter to provide spatial derivatives of arbitrary quantities,
   and that shaders have the ability to alter geometry, since no hidden-surface
   decisions have been made yet.  Derivatives give a straightforward way to
   compute surface normals, and to estimate sampling rates for anti-aliasing.
   Contrary to Speranza (above) micropolygons are not sampled at their
   midpoints.  Rather, color is computed at vertices, with the intent that it
   be Gouraud-interpolated across micropolygons.
<P>
4) After shading, break grids apart into individual micropolygons,
   which are hidden using a Z-buffer algorithm.  The Z-buffer samples
   are randomly jittered in space, time and lens position to allow
   anti-aliasing, motion blur and depth-of-field blur.  To handle transparent
   surfaces, each sample has a list of visible micropolygons.  After
   all micropolygons have been sampled, those that overlap other buckets
   are forwarded to the appropriate bucket lists.  Transparent values in
   the Z-buffer sample lists are collapsed to single pixel values by
   compositing, and the final sample values are filtered to produce pixel
   values.
<P>
I'm not sure why you say that Reyes is incompatible with ray tracing. All
that is required is to make a copy of the input geometry in a geometric
search structure when it's read, and trace rays when a shader requires it.
PRMan doesn't ray trace because we don't see a demand for it, not because it's
hard to do - it's not.

What do you want for an answer when, say, the polygon is a triangle? I can

Getting the new edges is trivial: every line in the plane may be written in
the form  a x + b y = c  for a unique unit vector (a,b) pointing to the

by  a x + b y = c + d.

If you really need the set of points which are a perpendicular distance away

<P>
Even defining exactly what the offset polygon should look like is nontrivial
if the original polygon is nonconvex.  The &quot;correct definition&quot;, in my
opinion, is the result of growing the offset polygon outward from the
original polygon.  Whenever an offset vertex runs into an offset edge, split
the offset polygon into two pieces at the point of collision and continue.
Whenever an offset edges shrinks down to a point, delete it, create a new
offset vertex, and continue.
<P>
The fastest practical algorithm for computing offset polygons runs in O(n^2)
time where n is the number of edges in the original polygon. Perhaps counter
to intuition, you can do slightly better if most of the vertices of the
polygon are CONCAVE.  The time bound becomes O(n log n + nr), where r is the
number of CONVEX vertices.  If the polygon is totally convex, you can compute
any offset polygon in linear time using exactly the algorithm Dave described.

I'm in the process of writing a 3D object viewer in OpenGL (which is the
easiest/nicest 3D API I've every used I might add) - the problem I'm having
is this:
<P>
The 3D program which uses the object format I'm displaying renders everything
as double-sided polygons - however, OpenGL doesn't! When I attempt to render
these polygons in OpenGL some of them will always appear facing the wrong way
- i.e. the model looks like it has holes it in. I know this is happening as I
can spin the model round and see the reversed polygons through holes in the
other side!
<P>
So... does anyone know how I can fix this? I had an idea of &quot;doubling up&quot;
each polygon, i.e. create two polygons for each polygon in the mesh and
reverse the normal for the second copy - this would work but makes the model
twice as large (and slower to draw!). Does anyone know of a fix in OpenGL for
this or an algorithm to correct flipped normals in solid models (I know it
can be done as programs like Lightwave/Rhino have a feature which can do
exactly that!).

I think I know what you're on about.  I have to import a mesh from a POV file
into my program.  The problem is that POV is a raytracer and doesn't care
about triangle winding.  This means I have to rewind the mesh once it has
been loaded into my program.  I have an algorithm that works (although I'm
sure there is far better), which I've implemented in my CTriMesh class so
that meshes can rewind themselves.  Although I deal only with triangles which
makes things a lot easier, I think the same algorithm could be used in your
case also.
<P>
Anyway, I will now *attempt* to describe the algorithm (If y'all know of
anything better, let me know)...
<P>
NOTE: works only for non-self-intersecting objects.

- Choosing the first polygon in the object and find out if it is facing the
right way.  This is done by:

        - Calculating the surface normal of the polygon and treating it
        as an infinite vector starting from the center point of the polygon.

        - Then check this vector against all the other polygons
        to see how many it intersects.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
        - If there are an odd number of intersections, then the polygon is
        not facing the right way, so rewind it.
</PRE>
<P>
- Now you have one polygon that is correct it is simple to find the others. I
base the next bit around the fact that if two polygons are both facing the
same way (having the same winding, e.g. counterclockwise), their shared edges
must have opposite direction vectors.

This wouldn't work for an object that described (say) the inside of a room.
This might be as simple as an inside-out cube (i.e. a cube with all the faces
pointing inwards). Your code would see exactly one intersection (which is an
odd number) and turn the room into a normal outward facing cube.
<P>
I don't think there is any way to distinguish between a cube and a 'room' and
automatically do the right thing.

Holes aren't a problem, but other mesh defects, like isolated faces and
duplicate edges will cause some faces not to be corrected. And a Moebius
strip or Klein bottle will hang the algorithm, so you have to detect
examining the same face twice.  My point is that you have to protect the
algorithm against failure to terminate.  This requires some extra bookkeeping.
<P>
This algorithm is O(N).
<P>
Counting surface crossings is a very expensive way to solve this problem;
it's O(N^2).  You also have all the usual problems with ambiguous cases where
the normal crosses very near an edge or vertex.

There is the view from inside/view from outside problem, as you point out.
For self-intersecting surfaces, it's even worse; you could be inside one
region but not all of them.

Your algorithm only works for manifold geometry. For non-manifold solids with

solid with holes, it will not work.

I think Duncan's first step, i.e., ray casting for finding or forcing a
correct face normal is most general. The second half of his algorithm is not
general, though. I used the ray casting to correct bad normals for
arbitrarily complex solids, using a BSP tree to speed up the search for
intersections.

If you know your solids to be manifold, Duncan's method should work
reasonably quickly.

This is a problem in mesh fixup.  If you have connectivity information, then
the method proposed by Duncan Colvin, which makes sure that one polygon is
oriented outwards, then propagates that information to its neighbours, should
work.
<P>
But if you don't know which polygons are adjacent to which others, the
problem is harder.  There is one approach which will work in such cases,
assuming objects don't share faces:
<P>
It's an idea by T.M. Murali and Tom Funkhouser.  The idea is to throw the
polygons into a BSP tree, which subdivides space into convex cells, and then
to figure out which of those cells are solid, and which ones are empty.  Once
you know which cells are solid, you can unambiguously orient the polygons on
its boundary.
<P>
Each cell is assigned a &quot;solidity&quot; value (-1 if empty, +1 if solid, in
between if we're not sure).  Unbounded cells are known to be empty. Each cell
votes on its neighbour.  Suppose cell A and cell B are neighbours, and A has
solidity &quot;x&quot;.  If the two cells are separated by a polygon, then A votes that
B has solidity -x.  If there is no separating polygon, A votes that B has
solidity x (same as A).  If there is a partial polygon separating the two
cells, A's vote depends on how much of the boundary is occluded, the vote
being somewhere between -x and +x, depending on the fraction of the boundary
taken up by the polygon.
<P>
The sum of the votes is a linear equation, relating one cell's solidity to
the solidities of its neighbours.  All the votes together give a system of
linear equations, with the solidities as the unknowns.  The rest is (sparse)
matrix numerical analysis.
<P>
This method also corrects for numerical errors and non-coincident vertices,
all without user-adjustable error tolerances.

Eric Haines comments (not on Usenet, just here):
<P>
A few years ago I spent a lot of time working on just this problem. Duncan
gives the basic principle (edges of opposite directions) and two basic parts
of the problem: establishing a &quot;seed&quot; polygon which all other polygons orient
themselves to, and then traversing the connecting polygons and flipping face
orientation as needed. As far as establishing a face which points outwards, I
used Gavin Bell's method, discussed in <A HREF="rtnv7n5.html#art16">RTNv7n5</A>. I will go over this method
here, and also discuss some of the problems encountered when using it. My own
goal was to determine whether a mesh could be properly oriented. If it could
not, for whatever reason, then I would note that the mesh could not use
culling when displaying it (the user could override this setting).
<P>
Using something like a BSP tree to sort the polygons and so establish
connectivity is one approach. Personally, I went for coding simplicity and
used the qsort sorter to find matching edges. Each edge for each polygon had
an edge record made for it, pointing back to what polygon it was from. The
edge record also included pointers to the two vertices it was made from and a
flag as to whether it was flipped or not.
<P>
Here's the technique for using qsort: first, within the edge record the two
vertices saved are always ordered such that the first vertex is &quot;before&quot; the
second. Basically, the X's of the two endpoints are compared and the point
with the lower value is saved first. In case of a tie, the Y's, then the Z's
are used.
<P>
Then, all the vertices can be sorted by giving qsort a simple routine to
compare each edge for a &quot;before&quot; condition. This test involves doing the
&quot;before&quot; test for the first vertices; if identical, then the second two
vertices are compared.  At the end of the sort, the edges are in order, and
identical edges are next to each other in the list.
<P>
This algorithm was probably overkill - I didn't want a sorted list so much as
just wanting the clusters of identical edges. To me this meant I wanted to
use a hashing scheme, where the six coordinate values of the edge's two
vertices would be used in the hashing function. For some reason my attempt at
hashing code never really bought me much more speed in practice, though. My
feeling is that a BSP scheme would also be costly - involved to code, and the
BSP gives much more information than is needed for the problem (all we need
are edge matches, we don't care about edge proximity).
<P>
Anyway, once you have the matching edges, you can build up links from each
polygon to its neighbors. This process will give you one or more continuous
meshes (where all the polygons are connected). You then properly orient the
polygons in each continuous mesh so that they all face the same direction,
using the edge rule Duncan gave (it doesn't matter which direction, just as
long as they are all consistent - we'll correct the direction in a minute).
John Nagle is correct in that you do need a little bookkeeping to keep track
of what faces you've checked. Gory details follow, skip to the next paragraph
if you don't care. I personally just used a stack and a flag for each
polygon: grab any polygon as a seed, flag it as done, flip its neighboring
polygons (those sharing an edge) as needed, flag each as done, and then put
each on a stack. Pop the stack, and if a neighbor is unflagged as tested then
flip the neighbor and flag it and push it in turn. When the stack is empty
then all connecting polygons have been visited and oriented.
<P>
This orientation process is sometimes easier said than done: some cruddy
models out there have edges which are shared by, say, three polygons, making
it impossible to determine locally (i.e. without looking at the mesh as a
whole) which orientation all three faces should have. This is not a
theoretical problem: there's an old DXF head file out there which has ears
that attach in just this way to the head, giving edges shared by three faces.
Nonetheless, almost all models have all edges shared by at most two polygons.
Note that if you detect any edge in a continuous mesh that belongs to only
one polygon, you then do not have a solid (manifold, essentially) surface. If
a surface is not solid, you're now definitely playing the odds when it comes
to trying to guess the surface's proper orientation; more on that after the
final step.
<P>
The final step is finding which way to orient each continuous mesh. If the
object is solid, Gavin's method works great: you take the centroid of the
bounding box around the mesh (note that the point does not have to be inside
the solid for the following to work) and compute the volume defined this
point and each individual polygon in the mesh, preserving the sign of the
volume of each.  Summed together, these volumes will give a total volume
which is positive or negative. If it's negative, reverse the sense of all of
the faces in the mesh.  You're done.
<P>
Well, there are a few things to worry about. As Steve Baker points out, your
model could actually be a room, in which case you're in trouble, getting
exactly the wrong answer. In theory this is true, there's no perfect
algorithm, but in practice what it means is that you should provide the user
with the ability to override the algorithm determined face culling settings
(e.g. turn off culling - probably a good idea for a room, so you can see it
from the outside - or reverse the face orientations as a whole). Alternately,
for this special case, you could use the viewpoint and test it against the
solid - if a test ray hits a backface as the closest hit, then the solid is a
room and so should be reversed.
<P>
Pathological self-intersecting objects (which are a pain to detect and
extremely rare in the real world of CG [I've never seen one]) don't have a
right answer as far as being single sided goes, but Gavin's test will ensure
that the surface with the most volume enclosed faces outwards.
<P>
Another problem occurs if you apply your algorithm to meshes which are not
solid (and which are the majority of models you'll find out there, as most
are not made on a solids modeling system). If, for instance, you have two
separate continuous meshes representing a box, with one mesh being the lid,
you will run into problems if the lid turns out to be concave, for example.
In this case the centroid of the lid will truly be outside it and, because
the lid is not solid, a &quot;solid&quot; will be formed between the centroid and the
lid's polygons which will cause the lid to face inwards. There are many other
surfaces which will fool the algorithm; for example, a flat lid with thin
raised letters will also raise the centroid above the lid and create more
volume to be computed outside the lid.
<P>
One solution to this problem is to take the volume of both meshes with
respect to the centroid of the box enclosing both, and ensure both have a
positive volume. However, this won't work in many cases: you have to know
beforehand that the two meshes make up the same solid object. Another
possibility is that you may not have to do the volume test at all if the
polygon vertices have their own vertex normals - these can be used to give a
sense of which part is the outside (if they can be trusted).
<P>
Alejo Hausner's answer is interesting; has anyone had experience with using
Funkhouser's solution?

What's Mesa?</A></FONT> by Brian Paul (<A HREF="mailto:brianp@ra.avid.com">brianp@ra.avid.com</A>)
</H4>
[Mesa's not a ray tracer, and I've covered it before in the RTN, but it bears
mentioning again. It's grown considerably since the last time I saw it, and
the fact that it has 3Dfx support and multi-threading is pretty great. -EAH]
<P>
Mesa is a free implementation of the OpenGL API which runs on Unix, Windows
95/NT, Macintosh, and most other computers.
<P>
Version 2.6 was released in February.  The most exciting new development has
been 3-D hardware support- specifically, support for the 3Dfx Voodoo hardware
on Linux and Windows.  Performance depends the CPU and other factors but up
to several hundred thousand 3-D textured triangles can be drawn per second.
Not bad for a free graphics library and a sub-$200 graphics card!
<P>
Version 3.0 of Mesa is in development.  It will feature an implementation of
the pending OpenGL 1.2 specification (perhaps the first &quot;to market&quot;). Also,
version 3.0 will feature the multi-texture extension which supports
simultaneous application of multiple texture maps.  The new 3Dfx Voodoo2
chipset supports this feature.
<P>
Perhaps those most enthusiastic about Mesa's 3Dfx support have been gamers.
ID Software has released versions of Quake (I and II) for Linux with 3Dfx
support.  Several other 3Dfx/Linux games are now available and more are in
development.
<P>
Other Mesa developments in progress include further hardware support,
multi-threading, and X server integration.

Multithreading Mesa</A></FONT>, by John Stone (<A HREF="mailto:johns@ultra2.cs.umr.edu">johns@ultra2.cs.umr.edu</A>)
</H4>
Christoph Poliwoda and I have been working on adding multithreading features
to Mesa, which allow an OpenGL programmer to safely use multiple threads,
each thread potentially performing OpenGL operations in its own active
rendering context.  The work we've completed so far has added thread-safety
features for Unix platforms using POSIX threads and Unix International (aka
Sun) threads.
<P>
With threads, a programmer may render to multiple OpenGL contexts
simultaneously, potentially offering a gain in performance, when run on
multiprocessor machines.
<P>
Through the use of &quot;sort last&quot; style depth compositing operations, rendering
of exceedingly complex depth buffered scenes can easily be accelerated.
Other potential uses involve rendering to multiple windows concurrently, with
potential performance improvements on multiprocessor systems.
<P>
Since the multithreading work is still in the early stages, the full range of
potential applications hasn't been explored yet.  As we make progress adding
thread safety to more of the Mesa drivers, we should be able to further
explore the potential uses of multithreaded OpenGL rendering, providing demos
of multithreading tricks that work well, in future releases of Mesa.

[The Lukaszewski paper is interesting (the others are probably interesting,
too, but I have not seen them). Say you are using stochastic ray tracing for
shadows, shooting a large number of shadow rays at a light disk. This is
obviously expensive, as many rays are shot for each shadow test.  The
author's idea is to &quot;explode&quot; the original objects in a scene with respect to
the area light. If the exploded object is hit by a ray traveling to the
center of the light, then that object must be tested against the bundle of
rays; but, if missed then that object can be ignored entirely for the entire
bundle. This results in great savings, as there are many samples which are
fully illuminated by the area light and these can be quickly categorized as
such. Only samples which are in the penumbra or umbra have to have the whole
bundle shot. The authors also consider imploding the objects - if a test ray
hits such an object it means that the sample is fully in the umbra. -EAH]
