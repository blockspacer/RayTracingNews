One or two things have happened since the last issue, back in August.  We
released a product called TriSpectives, which is a fun modeling/rendering/
animation package for Windows 95 and NT.  Since I am now involved in a public
commercial enterprise (prior to this we were mostly doing behind the scenes
work for HP), I will generally avoid discussing in the RT News such products
as !FalseSpace, 3D-Atelier, LightSwell, RayReverie, and AutoPUNK [hmmm, that
calls for a contest:  if you are one of the first three to identify these five
commercial products I just paraphrased, you win a 30 day trial version of
TriSpectives].  Oh, and I will also avoid mentioning in the RT News
TriSpectives, that's T-R-I... just kidding.  But, since this is my last
chance, check out <A HREF="http://www.eye.com">http://www.eye.com</A> for TriSpectives info, etc; the freebies
page is my favorite area.  Also, we're hiring people - see the Company Info
page for the latest listings.
<P>
I am glad to have an excuse to no longer track in the RT News all the various
commercial packages, as that is a full time job and then some.  Instead the RT
News will focus more on research issues, on free or extremely cheap software,
and on other resources both on-line and off.  If you are interested in the
commercial scene, check out the Tessellation Times
(<A HREF="http://www.3dartist.com/tess/tessmain.htm">http://www.3dartist.com/tess/tessmain.htm</A>), which is associated with _3D
Artist_ magazine.  It is an excellent bi-weekly source of information on
commercial rendering trends, and amazingly enough is free.
<P>
jgt:  I am one of around ten editors of the new "journal of graphics tools",
from A.K. Peters (Alice Peters helped produce the first volume of _Graphics
Gems_).  Ronen Barzel (<A HREF="mailto:ronen@pixar.com">ronen@pixar.com</A>) of Pixar is the Editor in Chief, and
Andrew Glassner is the founding editor.  Think "Graphics Gems" and "Numerical
Recipes" and you have a sense of what sort of articles we are after:  useful
results, tutorials, guidelines for choosing algorithms, and so on.  The
journal is peer reviewed (academics take note), and now has a web site,
courtesy of the ACM, at <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/jgt">http://www.acm.org/jgt</A> .
<P>
The only fun computer toy I have bought recently is the Snappy Video Snapshot
(on the web at <A HREF="http://www.play.com/pages/snaphead.html">http://www.play.com/pages/snaphead.html</A>).  What a cute thing:
for about $200 or less it is a phaser sized box with a 9 volt battery which
plugs into your parallel port and hooks up to a video camera, VCR, or TV.
Bring up the software and you can capture video shots on your computer at
three different resolutions and up to 24 bits of color.  It is fast to install
and use (though catching exactly the right shot from a video can take a few
tries).  Also, it comes with Gryphon Morph, a nice image morphing package, and
Fauve Matisse "lite", a reasonable natural paint program.  It is pretty easy
to take pictures of friends, pull them in, then morph one into the other.  Why
am I talking about it here?  Because it is also a pretty good way to scan in
materials and photos for use as textures.  When you use a perfectly still
video image you can up the scanning quality within Snappy's software and
multiple frames are blended and filtered to give pretty sharp images.  It
beats a flatbed scanner for cost, speed (faster than a scanner, and no waiting
to get film developed), and amount of desktop real estate it takes.

Results of the Name that Area Ratio Contest,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines and Arijan Siska (<A HREF="mailto:arijan@kette.fer.uni-lj.si">arijan@kette.fer.uni-lj.si</A>)
</H4>
So, the problem posed was:  given the set of all arbitrary triangles (i.e.  3
random dots, anywhere on a 2D plane) and a 2D bounding box around each, what
is the average ratio of the area covered by the triangle vs.  the box?
<P>
The trivial answer is:  1/2, because I did not properly state that the 2D
bounding box is axis aligned (sorry about that).  So, what is the answer for
axis aligned bounding boxes?
<P>
This problem turned out to be a lot trickier than I first thought.  When I
asked it, I figured out the answer for any given triangle where all three
points of the triangle touch the bounding box.  The gist is that you do not
have to worry about the infinite plane for this case, as the ratio between the
triangle and bounding box is all that matters.  So, the bounding box can be
thought of as size 1x1, and one corner of the triangle is always at one of the
bounding box corners, and the other two points on the triangle can freely move
along the two edges opposite this corner:
<P>
<PRE>
            +-- this triangle point can be anywhere along this edge
            V
       1+---*-----+
        | X       |
        |         * &lt;-- and this tri. point can be anywhere along this edge
        |         |
        |         |}Y
        |         |
        *---------+
        ^         1
        +-- and this point must be at a corner
</PRE>
<P>
With the distances X and Y as shown, the area of the triangle is:
<P>
<PRE>
    A = 1 - X/2 - Y/2 - (1-X)*(1-Y)/2 = (1-X*Y)/2
</PRE>
<P>
Doing a double integral of X and Y each over [0,1] gives the answer 3/8ths.
<P>
Unfortunately, it's a bit harder than that:  what if just two of the
triangle's points touch the bounding box (i.e.  are at opposite corners of the
bounding box) and the third point is somewhere inside the box?  Call these
"two point" triangles.  This ratio is not so hard to compute, it turns out to
be 1/6th (see solution).  But, what is the ratio between these two point
triangles and the previous, three points on the bounding box types?
Personally, I struggled with this one and did not feel comfortable with my
answer, as it did not closely agree with the empirical answer my C program
found.
<P>
The person who won this contest is Arijan Siska, who came up with a good proof
showing that the ratio between "two point" and "three point" types as 1:2.  He
made the same oversight that I did (forgetting the "two point" types), but
when informed of this, quickly derived the rest and sent in a convincing
answer, which follows.  Jack Ritter (<A HREF="mailto:jritter@netcom.com">jritter@netcom.com</A>) gets an honorable
mention for getting the empirical answer first, 0.3055, by performing monte
carlo testing.  Joe Demers (<A HREF="mailto:joed@graphics.usc.edu">joed@graphics.usc.edu</A>) had a solution that was
very close, the first to get 3/8th and 1/6th as the sub-answers, and almost
but not quite coming up with a way to blend the two (like I said, nor did I).
<P>
No one took up the challenge of determining the average area of an arbitrary
non-intersecting quadrilateral and its bounding box (nor do I envy anyone the
task!).
<P>
The rest of the solution follows, in Arijan's words.
<P>
____
<P>
- [for two point triangles] you end up with a triangle with one side going
from (0,0) to (1,1) and the third point being anywhere within the unit square.
<P>
- if the third point touches the unit square the triangle has already been
processed by the case with all points on the b. box.
<P>
- area of this 2point on b. box triangle is:
<P>
<PRE>
   +------------* (1,1)         pt = 1/2 - (1-x)y/2 - x y - (1-y)x/2
   |          / |                  = (1-x-y)/2
   |        / / |
   |      /  /  |               average pt = 1/6
   |    / pt /  |
   |  /  ---*------
   |/ ---   |   | y
   *--------|---+
(0,0)       | x
</PRE>
<P>
- now the portion of 2point and 3point on b. box triangles out of all triangles:
<P>
If we think of a triangle as a two point line with third point added to it, we
can state the condition for triangle to touch b. box in only two points is to
have the third point inserted between first two points in x and y dimension or
inserted beyond first two points - see the picture:
<P>
<PRE>
        A  |    |            point x3 has to be in the regions A B C or D.
           |x1  |
      -----*----+---------
           |\ B |
           | \  |
           |  \ |
           | C \|x2
      -----+----*---------
           |    | D
           |    |
</PRE>
<P>
Let's take a one dimensional example:
<P>
1.  We use finite region [0,1] in which we generate random points.  This
region can be later expanded to infinity without affecting the results
(probabilities).
<P>
<PRE>
2. Generate 2 random points:
       0   x1     x2         1
       |----*======*---------|
</PRE>
<P>
probability of a third point x3 being placed between these two points is equal
to the average distance between x1 and x2.  That distance (= probability) is
<P>
Integrate[x-y,{x,0,1},{y,0,x}]*2 = 1/3           # this is Mathematica notation
<P>
3. In two dimensions the probability of the third point being in the regions
<P>
                A       B & C       D
A B C or D is (1/3)^2 + (1/3)^2 + (1/3)^2 = 1/3. This gives us ratio:
<P>
2 p. on b. box triangles : 3 p on b box tri. = 1/3 : 2/3
<P>
- total area can be stated as:
<P>
2/3 * 3/8 + 1/3 * 1/6 = 11/36 ~ 0.3055555555555555555
<P>
Hope this time I'm right!
<P>
I've done a random test myself, and the result for 33,619,968 triangles gives
an average area ratio of 0.305586785790013.  So my analytical solution should
be a correct one.

Another Contest: Sphere in Box ratio,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines
</H4>
I have another problem, again a useful result for ray tracing:  what is the
average cross-sectional area of the projection of a sphere vs.  a bounding box
around the sphere?  In other words, given a sphere in a bounding box, what is
the chance that an arbitrary ray (originating outside the bounding box)
hitting the box will also hit the sphere?
<P>
[hint:  actually, this question can be restated to get rid of the sphere,
though this does not make it any easier to compute.]
<P>
I *think* this is pretty easy, but right now I have not sat down and figured
it out myself.

How intricate do you want to get?  Sir Hamilton, who invented the beasts,

Per Christensen, Eric Stollnitz, David Salesin and I have been doing some
research on extending clustering to glossy global illumination.  Last month we
submitted a paper "Clustering for Glossy Global Illumination" summarizing our
research to ACM TOG.  The paper is available online via anonymous ftp from
<A HREF="ftp://espresso.cs.washington.edu/pub/danix/clustering">ftp://espresso.cs.washington.edu/pub/danix/clustering</A> .
<P>
An earlier version of this paper was submitted to Siggraph 95 (and was
rejected).  Fortunately, the comments of the anonymous reviewers challenged us
to substantially improve both the paper and the implementation.
<P>
The highlights of the results section are:  a comparison with RADIANCE on a
glossy "sphereflake" model and nice global illumination solutions for an
architectural environment with ~8000 initial surfaces, most of which are
glossy.
<P>
If you happen to read the paper and have any comments, please e-mail them to
me.

BMRT Update

[BMRT is a RenderMan compliant ray tracer/radiosity renderer.  See <A HREF="rtnv8n1.html">RTNv8n1</A>.]

BMRT is still going strong.  In fact, I just updated the FTP site
(<A HREF="ftp://ftp.gwu.edu/pub/graphics/BMRT">ftp://ftp.gwu.edu/pub/graphics/BMRT</A>) with a new revision that has
some enhancements and bug fixes.  I've had a WWW site for a while,
too: <A HREF="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html">http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html</A>.  One new
feature is that I use the Mesa library (freeware OpenGL clone), so
all the non-SGI ports now support the polygon previewer and other
features that were previously only enabled on my SGI version.
<P>
The software is quite widely used, including by a lot of well known
studios (who mostly use PRMan, but occasionally use BMRT for
particular effects that are easier with ray tracing).  It was used
recently for some effects on the show "Star Trek: Voyager", and also
was used to render the new video logo for the Utah Jazz (NBA team),
which apparently is shown whenever their games are broadcast.

Form Factor of a Cow
<P>
[This is a radiosity joke, "what's the form factor of a cow?", and the fact
that someone actually computed it once made it truly strange.  What adds to it
is to find out that the simplification for a cow is, well, read on.  -EAH]
<P>
I did look up the cow paper once, and it is for real.  The motivation was
designing heating systems for the care of livestock.
<P>
Here is a summary:
<P>
"Uses mechanical integrator to measure factors from various wall elements to a
cow, and presents some results for size of equivalent sphere that gives same
factor as cow.  It is found that the sphere origin should be place at
one-fourth of the withers-to-pin-bone length back of the withers, at a height
above the floor of two-thirds the height of the withers, and the equivalent
sphere radius should be 1.8, 2.08 or 1.78 times the heart girth for exchange
with the floor and ceiling, sidewalls, or front and back walls respectively.
Also discusses exchange between cows and entire bounding walls, floor and
ceiling and between parallel cows."

I don't think I kept a copy of the paper, so please don't ask me for it.  As I
recall, the authors were from California, and the paper was initially read at

3D Point Hashing,
</A></FONT>
by Steve Worley (<A HREF="mailto:spworley@best.com">spworley@best.com</A>)
</H4>
[I asked Steve if he had any good hashing function for 3D points in space.  In
other words, is there some good function that takes a 3D point and gives back
a hash value in some range, and has a good spread of hashing numbers.  For
example, this can be useful for finding and deleting duplicate vertices, or
for getting a repeatable seed value for a 3D procedural texture function or
fractal terrain generator.  Making a function which does not lead to
patterning or clumping is not obvious; for example, the function "int(x+y+z)
modulus range" would be a bad function:  all points within 0 &lt;= x+y+z &lt; 1, a
sort of diagonal slab, and so all have the same hash number.  If you made a
fractal mountain with this function, you would probably see diagonal strips at
the same altitude.  Or if your entire object fell inside one slab, all the
vertices would have the same hash number and so not save you any sorting time.
This problem is called aliasing.  -EAH]
<P>
I've been working on fast but thorough hashing.
<P>
OK, the major problem with FP numbers is that are 17.000000000 and
17.000000001 the same number?  If no (in other words, ANY difference
makes them distinct) you run into problems if any operations have been
applied to them. Copying usually does not corrupt them.
<P>
A strategy for FP I expect would deal with the 4 (or 8) bytes
that make up the value - converting to some integer/exponent or
whatever is horribly slow.
<P>
So basically you have a 3 sets of 4 bytes, and you want to mash all
twelve bytes into a unique hash. Lots of ways to do this, some fast,
some very good.
<P>
Probably the fastest version would be something like:
<P>
<PRE>
float position[3];
unsigned char *byte;
<P>
byte=(unsigned char *)position; /* lets us address the floats as 12 bytes */
<P>
unsigned long hash;
hash = 3*byte[0] + 5*byte[1] + 7*byte[2] + 11*byte[3] + .... (prime)*byte[n]
</PRE>
<P>
This is <B>very</B> fast. However it can suffer from aliasing, especially when
the
input float values have zero bytes in their binary representation.
<P>
The high quality way is to use an "S-box" to mash the bits around thoroughly.
[This is THE theme of cryptography]. An S-box is just a way of taking
one byte and outputting another, with a (random, usually) truth table.
In practice an 8x8 S-box (8 bits in, 8 bits out) can be made really easily
by the pseudocode:
<P>
<PRE>
  for i=0 to 255
    sbox[i]=i;
  next i
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
  for i=0 to 255
    j=random(0,255)
    swap sbox[i] with sbox[j]
  next i
</PRE>
<P>
Then the (very high quality) hash of a byte x is sbox[x].  All an S-box is is
bit-swizzling. It is mapping sets of bits to new sets of bits.  However it does
it completely nonlinearly, which is what you want.
<P>
To combine this with many bytes, you can do a lot of things.  For your
purposes, it's probably enough to do...
<P>
<PRE>
hash = 3*sbox[byte[0]] + 5*sbox[byte[1]^123] + 7*sbox[byte[2]^47]...
        + (prime)*sbox[byte xor some random (fixed) number];
</PRE>
<P>
The mults probably are not even horribly necessary.
<P>
Actually in both cases you may want to use larger primes, like 101, 247, etc,
not 3, 5, 7.
<P>
Ken Perlin uses the algorithm:
<P>
<PRE>
hash = (sbox[(X+sbox[(Y+sbox[Z%256])%256])%256];
</PRE>
<P>
This is a compromise, since it has excellent behavior locally (as the LSB
changes) but it causes repeated areas, i.e.
hash(x,y,z)=hash(x+i*256,y+j*256,z+k*256).  It is more efficient than a longer
hash since it needs only three sbox lookups.  This hash is good for generating
noise samples on an integer lattice but is terrible for finding matching
vertices (e.g. 1.0, 1.5, and 1.99 as inputs all give the same hash number
out).
<P>
There are lots and lots and lots of variations.  But the sbox method is
extremely good as a basic tool to use. If you are looking for cryptographically
secure hashing, you can chain rules, like hashing each byte into a new byte
with a new sbox, then shifting the full 12 bytes right 4 bits and hashing
again. In crypto, they often do 10 "rounds" of this kind of iteration.
<P>
I should mention that my main hashing has been for stuff like fractal
noise values at gridpoints.
<P>
It is surprisingly easy to get bad aliasing on a uniform grid!! Aliasing
you can actually SEE as repeated patches. This is why I was researching
all this s-box stuff. Luckily s-boxes only take 256 bytes of ram and
a little precompute.
<P>
Trick #3: make a 512 byte array of your sbox appended to itself,
so sbox[256]=sbox[0], sbox[257]=sbox[1]...
<P>
Then you can do:
<P>
hash= sbox[byte[0]+sbox[byte[1]+sbox[byte[2]+... ]]]]
<P>
[the 512 byte array is just so that you do not overflow when adding. -EAH]
<P>
This is a REALLY good hash, but only gives you 0-255 out.
<P>
One other note, you can move to a 16x16 S-box, same idea. Your memory usage
jumps from 256 (or 512) bytes to 120 or 240K. But then you are chunking two
bytes at a time. It's a better hash, and nearly twice as fast (after the sbox
is built).
<P>
There are even more details than this: stuff about collisions
from "pipelines" when things are just one bit different that for the best
hashing you want to avoid.

subdivision should be between 8-10.
<P>
The results from my BSP- and 5D-Implementation show that 5D is faster than BSP
only if the scene contains many low-reflective/refractive polygons with small
changes in curvature (teapot.nff, for example).  For other .NFFs of SPD, such
as balls.nff, jacks.nff etc., 5D is much slower than BSP, and the required
memory for 5D is enormous compared to BSP.  Another problem is that the main
advantage of 5D over BSP is not having to compute the voxel-path, but if the
BSP-tree is balanced, it is possible to find the closest intersection very
soon after few voxel-tests.  And, the beam/box overlap-test for the
reclassification of candidates lists undermines the efficiency of 5D, too.  I
think 5D is only attractive for eye-rays and shadow-rays, because with these
coherency is high enough.

For these tests, GX uses BSP as a first method and ABVH as the second, which

examines pure 5D and hybrids using this scheme, along with an in-depth study
of making such algorithms parallelizable.

George Simiakis writes:
"If you ask me what I really think about 5D, I believe it is good for low
complexity scenes with lots of ray coherence, but I prefer 3D methods (or the
2D grid, see my thesis) as an all-around method.  In other words I prefer
scalability, general robustness and predictability of performance.  Ray
tracing may not be solved 100% but new improvements are bound to be
insignificant compared to improvements in the past.  I hope to work on
parallel radiosity now.  There is still some efficiency work to be done there."

Yep, I have written a little IBM Demo called 'The Attic', maybe you'll find it

[This is actually a fun trick, and can even be useful.  I once wrote a demo

with the z-buffer but not write to it, and could render into an overlay plane.
The effect:  you could have a fully ray traced camshaft or whatever and move a
semi-transparent (screen-door) square around through this scene and the object

Hierarchical Techniques for Glossy Global Illumination,
</A></FONT>
by Per Christensen (<A HREF="mailto:per@cs.washington.edu">per@cs.washington.edu</A>)
</H4>
Abstract:
<P>
This dissertation concerns efficient computation of realistic images.  To
compute realistic synthetic images, the effect of global illumination is
essential.  Ray tracing algorithms solve the global illumination problem for
specular interreflections, and radiosity algorithms solve it for diffuse
interreflections.  But computing a solution is more complicated when the
surfaces have glossy reflection.
<P>
This dissertation describes hierarchical techniques for efficient solution of
the glossy global illumination problem.  Two types of hierarchy are utilized:
wavelets to accurately represent radiance distributions on surface patches,
and clusters to approximately represent radiant intensity from groups of
surface patches.  Without hierarchical techniques, the solution time would be
quadratic in the number of patches and O(b^{1.5}) in the number of basis
functions b.  The hierarchical techniques make solution time linear in both
the number of patches and in the number of basis functions.  This reduction is
significant since the numbers of patches and basis functions are large for
accurate solutions in realistic environments.  Furthermore, directional
importance is used to focus refinement of the solution on parts that
contribute significantly to a particular view of the scene.
<P>
Our method is the first finite-element method capable of handling complex
glossy scenes.

Global Illumination SIGGRAPH meeting,
</A></FONT>
by Greg Ward (<A HREF="mailto:greg@theo.lbl.gov">greg@theo.lbl.gov</A>)
</H4>
Well, we just got out of our annual Siggraph [global illumination] lunch
meeting, so I thought I would jot some notes about it while it was still fresh
in my overcrowded brain.
<P>
There were about 20 of us attending, and I won't embarrass myself by
misspelling (or forgetting) everyone's name, but instead I'll just mention some
of the topics we covered and what was said about them.
<P>
<B>1. Sharing models and data</B>
<P>
To address need for shared models that are usable and useful for global
illumination, a new format has been developed called MGF (for Materials and
Geometry Format) and models and libraries are now available from:
<P>
<PRE>
        <A HREF="http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html">http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/HOME.html</A>
</PRE>
<P>
Or, if you only have ftp access, try:
<P>
<PRE>
        <A HREF="ftp://hobbes.lbl.gov/www/mgf/">ftp://hobbes.lbl.gov/www/mgf/</A>
</PRE>
<P>
This format supports a reasonable reflectance model, CIE XYZ and spectral
colors, and the IES luminaire data format for light sources.  A number of
models from Radiance and other sources have been collected, and we encourage
people with big hearts to add their own models to our collection.  Write to me
if you have any questions or want to get on the mailing list for how to
improve this format to meet our long-term needs.
<P>
<B>2. Setting up light sources</B>
<P>
Dan Wexler [see
<A HREF="#art15">
his article</A>] pointed out that one of the biggest time sinks
in animation and rendering for film is the setting up of light sources, and
that methods for making this more interactive were critical to this
application.  Specifically, he felt that a "deep raster" approach (similar to
that developed by Sequin et al and presented at Siggraph 4 years or so ago)
was a good way to go.  In general, he felt there needed to be more of an
emphasis on animation and interaction than there was in our current focus on
static environments and generating one really nice image.
<P>
<B>3. Image-based rendering</B>
<P>
Pete Shirley addressed a general question to the group about the relative
importance and promise of image-based rendering (ala Quicktime VR) versus
polygon-based methods.  The overall response seemed to indicate that indeed
image interpolation was a significant direction to head in the future, though
polygon rendering will continue to be important when object manipulating is
required and for nearby objects.  It seemed that at least five people there
were actively pursuing such techniques.  (Check out this year's Siggraph
proceedings on Plenoptic Modeling and Quicktime VR, also Nimeroff et al in
Eurographics Rendering Workshop '95.)
<P>
<B>4. Visibility processing</B>
<P>
Several people talked about the difficulty of geometric simplification and
other statistical or computational geometry methods for detecting visibility
changes or approximating visibility.  Christine Piatko of NIST reminded folks
that tracking visibility is an O(N^6) problem and not something you want to do
explicitly, and there was an interesting paper by Francois Sillion and George
Drettakis (similar in some respects to the one Francois presented at EGRW this
June) on approximating shadows.  Jeff Nimeroff of UPenn also mentioned the
work he had done with Julie Dorsey and Holly Rushmeier and presented at EGRW
on statistical measures of object visibility for looking at this problem.  It
was agreed by most that statistical measures or simplification were necessary
in large environments, though there is still much work to be done in this
area.
<P>
<B>5. Calibrated input and output</B>
<P>
Holly Rushmeier (who by the way is next year's Siggraph papers chair) talked a
little about the difficulty of obtaining accurate physical data from
real-world scenes, and a number of people lamented about the undetermined
nature of image-to-output mappings for computer monitors, printers and film
recorders.  It was suggested that these devices be measured, which is
certainly possible, and that this data be shared with the larger community.
(Hear, hear, let's all do it, etc.)  Holly and I also reminded people to look
at the conference room image measurements and model we have made available on
the web site:
<P>
<PRE>
        <A HREF="http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/compare.html">http://radsite.lbl.gov/mgf/compare.html</A>
</PRE>
<P>
From there, you can also pick up an online copy of our EGRW '95 paper on image
metrics if you haven't purchased the Springer-Verlag proceedings yet.
<P>
<B>6. Getting papers into Siggraph</B>
<P>
Henrik Wann Jensen of Denmark asked about the lack of papers covering global
illumination this year at Siggraph, and if this was a trend or what?  Holly
answered that there's a bias against incremental work in any field, and that
Siggraph tends to accept papers that are new directions rather than the
logical next step in a technique previously published.  Ian Ashdown of
Ledalite said that he had submitted something that reviewers liked except that
it didn't have any pretty pictures and was therefore rejected.  (No one had
anything to say to console him on this.)  I made the unsubstantiated claim
that it can help to provide evidence of a real-life application along with an
incremental improvement in one or more existing algorithms, and Holly agreed
that there must be a balance between application and innovation.
<P>
There is a lot of useful information by the way on next year's Siggraph in New
Orleans.  Look for the "new" icons on the web site:
<P>
<PRE>
        <A HREF="http://www.s95.siggraph.org/conferences/siggraph96/siggraph96.html">http://www.s95.siggraph.org/conferences/siggraph96/siggraph96.html</A>
</PRE>
<P>
In particular, you should be aware of the new electronic abstract requirement
for technical papers.
<P>
<B>7. Oracle-assisted rendering</B>
<P>
Another trend that people discussed (me for one) was the use of oracles to
decide when and where to apply which algorithms (a.k.a. "hacks") to improve
the speed and quality of renderings.  Some information may be derived from the
scene itself, but other assistance will always require the user to help the
program to guide the calculation.  This is not as bad as it sounds, since
users are after all necessary to rendering, so they may as well guide it.  I
directed people to my EGRW '95 paper on the subject, which I can make
available online if people are interested.  Although I don't plan to pursue
this too much myself, I think it continues to be an interesting and promising
direction for investigation.
<P>
<B>8. Rendering code available</B>
<P>
Philipp Slusallek of Erlangen Univ.  mentioned to the group that they have a
renderer that extends Renderman input to include global illumination
calculations (physically-based) and that code is available from him.  His
address is (<A HREF="mailto:slusallek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de">slusallek@informatik.uni-erlangen.de</A>) if you're interested.  (He's
going to hate me when he gets back.)
<P>
Remember also about the Blue Moon Ray Tracer, written by Larry Gritz
(<A HREF="mailto:lg@pixar.com">lg@pixar.com</A>) and available at:
<P>
<PRE>
        <A HREF="http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html">http://www.seas.gwu.edu/student/gritz/bmrt.html</A>
</PRE>
<P>
It also does some global illumination calculations, though I'm not in a
position to compare the two.
<P>
As long as I'm plugging other people's code, must mention my own for those of
you who have been asleep or locked up for some time:
<P>
<PRE>
        <A HREF="http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/HOME.html">http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/HOME.html</A>
</PRE>
<P>
Well, that's about it I guess.  Anyone else who was there and remembers stuff
I forgot or points I left out, please pipe in.  I tend to do a really bad job
at these sorts of summaries, and I neglected to take notes during the meeting,
so I'm relying here on my less-than-adequate memory.

Total Internal Reflection,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines, Greg Ward (<A HREF="mailto:greg@hobbes.lbl.gov">greg@hobbes.lbl.gov</A>), and Chris Larson (<A HREF="mailto:larson@kingston.cs.ucla.edu">larson@kingston.cs.ucla.edu</A>)
</H4>
I asked a few people:
<P>
        I've run into an interesting implementation problem (again) which I've
found annoying.  Imagine you've got something with a big index of refraction,
like a diamond, and you shoot a ray at it.  A refraction ray is spawned and
passes through the diamond.  Due to total internal reflection (TIR) (i.e. the
ray's past the critical angle) no refraction ray exits when this refracted ray
(the one passing through the diamond) now intersects the surface, only a
reflection ray is generated which bounces back through the diamond.  The normal
correction for TIR is to simply boost the reflection ray's contribution if the
refraction ray is not generated.
<P>
        However, what happens if this reflection ray again hits, TIR occurs,
and again only a reflection ray is spawned?  Say this happens again and again
until the maximum level of computation is reached and we call it quits.  What
happens at this point?  That is, how do you shade this bottommost ray?  Very
little color has been picked up along the way, as it is expected that the
reflection ray eventually hits something mostly diffuse and takes up that
color.
<P>
        Really, this is just a special case of the general problem of what
should happen when the maximum ray level is hit.  Currently my kludgy fix is
to say when the maximum level is hit we simply don't shoot the reflection ray
but return the background color times the reflectivity and call it a day.
I've also tried just taking the bottommost ray's surface and boost the diffuse
component, but this is scary.  I am interested to hear how other ray tracer
coders have handled this problem.  (Perhaps I can glue up the answers into an
article for the Ray Tracing News).
<P>
____
<P>
Greg Ward (<A HREF="mailto:greg@hobbes.lbl.gov">greg@hobbes.lbl.gov</A>) replied:
<P>
I don't think you will see black faces due to TIR because the light in a
mutifaceted gem eventually finds a surface at a passable angle.  If the
light started from inside a pane of glass or something, it might not ever
get out, it's true, but that's the way it is.  The light that can't get
out also couldn't get in, i.e. any incident angle up to 90 degrees refracts
to less than the TIR angle.
<P>
[Greg focusses on the gem case in particular, but I am interested
in some general solution for the situation.  Thinking about it later, I
realized that in some cases there just is no good answer:  TIR is how fiber
optics work, and rays down a fiber optic cable yields a huge ray depth. - EAH]
<P>
____
<P>
Chris Larson (<A HREF="mailto:larson@kingston.cs.ucla.edu">larson@kingston.cs.ucla.edu</A>) replied:
<P>
Two comments. First of all, I don't hard code any "maximum level" for rays;
rather, I maintain a fraction for each ray, indicating its contribution to
the intensity (color, whatever) assigned to the root ray. Recursion stops
when this fraction falls below one bit of intensity in the final color. I
suppose this is still a hard limit in one sense, but it allows as many 
reflections/refractions as necessary to obtain this approximation of the root
ray's color. It also has the nice property that reflected/refracted rays
which don't contribute much can be solved without recursing to a hard
maximum level. Although this could just as easily be done with the maximum
level approach, my method provides this without any additional complexity.
<P>
However, this method can still lead to infinite total internal reflection. To
combat that problem, rays are attenuated based upon the distance they travel
through any transparent (or translucent) media. This attenuation is based
upon the physical characteristics of the media in question (exponential decay
for non-conductors, different for conductors because the index of refraction
is complex for an electrically conductive medium; I think there is another
thread around here discussing this very point). Such attenuation is in
addition to the typical division of energy performed between reflected and
refracted rays.
<P>
Nothing about either of these approaches is new and different; it was simply
my chosen solution to the same problem.
<P>
[For more on adaptive depth, see IEEE CG&A, Roy Hall, A Testbed for Realistic
Image Synthesis, v.3, n.8, Nov. 1983.  This method bears repeating here as it
is a good technique to save time; I use it too.  But without a maximum depth
you can potentially bounce a ray forever, as with the fiber optic case.  After
getting people's insights, my conclusion for TIR for now is what Hall
concluded, that a maximum depth is called for just to avoid a near-infinite
compute time for each TIR ray.  However, this leads back to my original
question:  how to shade once I reach this maximum level?  If you have written
a ray tracer, please let me know how you treat this case.  -EAH]

Pretemporal Imaging Systems,
</A></FONT>
by Ken Musgrave and Eric Haines
</H4>
You, too, can get in on the technology Ken Musgrave and I are developing.  As
you may know, sometimes it is possible to get an index of refraction *less*
than 1.0.  Ken writes:
<P>
<PRE>
  "Anomalous dispersion", the peculiar asymptotic curves for refractive index
  vs. frequency which I mentioned before, can yield a refractive index of less
  than 1.0, but apparently only occurs at frequencies higher than visible light
  (e.g., UV and X rays).  Or so say Born & Wolf in "Principles of Optics", 1964
  edition, pp. 93.  Another reference I read contradicts this, saying that it
  happens in dyes -- which are necessarily colored, due to the presence of an
  absorption band in the visible frequencies.
</PRE>
<P>
We suspect that the 6000-8000 Angstrom area of the spectrum holds a roseate
coloured light which we can utilize in making spectacles.  By having an index
of refraction which is less than 1.0, the light itself then must be moving
faster than the speed of light in vacuum.  As you no doubt have surmised, such
spectacles would have the property of being able to look forward in time,
though admittedly only a small amount.  However, we believe with an elaborate
application of smoky dispersive materials and mirrors we can make a marketable
product.
<P>
Ken suggests the names:
<P>
<PRE>
    "Pretemporal imaging systems"
                or
    "Supersimultaneous transmission optics"
</PRE>
<P>
for the industrial version, but what we need is a good consumer brand name,
and that's where you can come in (my suggestions of Turbo-X-Lenses and
Tachyon-Lenses are lame in the extreme).  Just send us your suggestions along
with all your loose change and convertible bonds and we'll let you in on the
ground floor (or even the basement) of our enterprise.
<P>
I think we could have an initial public offering at SIGGRAPH at a nickel a
share (for all those nickels which Ken Perlin should have made for developing
turbulence functions).  I say we put all the initial money into the
exploration of amber colored zymurgical beverages and their optical properties
when placed in prism sided glass mugs.

the main difference being the use of lossless vs lossy compression.  Unlike
GIF, both support true color (PNG also supports palette based color.)

Tom Lane (organizer of the Independent JPEG Group) notes:
<P>
PNG is always going to be much faster at decompression than compression, same
as everything else that's based on the "zip" compression method.  This is the
right tradeoff for most applications:  you make an image file once and then
look at it many times.
<P>
PNG is strictly lossless.  On photo-like images it will never be able to beat
JPEG for file size; that's not the point of PNG.  The other side of the coin
is that JPEGed images can turn to mush after a few editing cycles due to
lossiness.  PNG files won't.
<P>
PNG is smaller than other lossless image formats.  For instance, it can store
a palette-color image in less space than GIF.  But lossy compression methods
will always beat lossless methods on file size; that's the only reason people
put up with the obvious drawbacks of a lossy method.

Last week at SigGraph I mentioned that the Cinematography literature is
replete with information concerning real-time global illumination.
<P>
Here are a couple of my favorite references:

American Cinematographer Manual
    Published by the American Society of Cinematographers (ASC), this is the
    Foley, vanDam (F&H) of all cameramen and lighting experts.  Complete
    descriptions of all types of cameras, lights, lenses, filters and supports
    are given along with comparison tables.  Techniques for special visual
    effects (background plates, compositing, miniatures, travelling mattes,
    optical printers), and special techniques (arial, underwater, arctic,
    tropical, day for night, stereo 3D, sound, television) are briefly
    discusses.  There's even a section on Computer Graphics.  This is a small
    book that can be found in many good book stores and sells for about $70.

Millerson, Gerald; "Lighting for Television and Film"; 3rd Ed.; Focal Press;
    This is a very good introduction on how to light for film and video.
    Excellent discussions of the aesthetic qualities of light and perception.
    The basic principals of lighting (key, fill, shadows, balance, direction,
    continuity) are summarized.  Detailed chapters on lighting people, the
    production process, atmospheric lighting, light sources and equipment,
    color temperature, picture control, scenery, and visual effects.  A great
    book to learn how to light a scene to achieve a specific mood.  First
    published in '72, third edition revised in '91.  ISBN 0-240-51299-5

These contain other references, and I will happily send you more if you send
me mail.  I think I might like the third one because the author makes special
mention of Haskell Wexler, who is, of course, not related to me in any way I
know of.  I am indebted to Jean Cunningham, one of our local lighting experts
for most of these references.
<P>
I cannot emphasize enough how much there is to learn from this body of
knowledge.  Good lighting with a bad renderer always looks better than bad
lighting with a good renderer, IMHO.

Getting Rid of the Divide,

[A common question when implementing z-buffer algorithms is how one can avoid
the division per pixel that is needed to correctly perform texture mapping.
Division is usually an expensive operation, so is worth avoiding at almost any
cost.  (Yes, this has nothing to do with ray tracing per se, but as I have
said before, I will include topics here that are interesting to me.  Also,
more and more renderers are becoming hybrid systems, where eye rays are done
using z-buffers, so it has some relevance).  -EAH]
<P>
Three possible ways of getting rid of the divide are:
<P>
<PRE>
   1 : lines of constant z (that's q to you, for some reason)
       First, find the 2-d, screenspace, line along which the polygon has
       constant z (or q). There exists such a line for any polygon in any
       orientation. Then scan convert your polygon along this line. As z
       is constant along this line, linear interpolation of the texture
       coordinates does give you the more or less correct result (as
       long as you do the divide along the poly's edges to get the correct
       values to interpolate between).
       pro's : - potentially very fast.
               - if all your poly's are walls/floors (ala doom/marathon),
                 this gets a lot easier because then the lines of constant
                 z are vertical/horizontal lines across the screen.
               - very easy to do light diminishing with distance (or fog).
       con's : - nasty implementation. You have to be *very* careful how
                 you scan convert along these lines in order to avoid holes
                 and/or multiple writes to the same pixel. This is especially
                 true for the edges.
               - as the on-screen line along which you are scan converting
                 is (necessarily) an approximation of the real line of
                 constant z, the texture coordinates will not be absolutely
                 correct.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
   2 : (scanline) subdivision.
       This is what you mention above: the divide and conquer approach.
       You linearly interpolate the texture coordinates, while making sure
       the distance across which you interpolate doesn't get too big. You
       can do this by cutting up big polygons into lots of smaller ones, or
       (the more popular approach) by sampling the texture coordinates at
       a couple of points for each scanline (by doing the divide) and
       interpolating between them.
       pro's : - relatively easy implementation.
               - when correctly implemented, easy to trade a bit of speed
                 for accuracy and vice versa. That is, you can simply
                 decide which combination of speed and accuracy looks best
                 after you've implemented it.
       con's : - there are usually still artifacts from the linear
                 interpolation visible. These are in part caused by:
               - hard to find a good rule for the subdivision process (how
                 to cut up the polygons/scanlines). This must be continuous
                 from frame to frame as sudden jumps in the places where
                 you cut/sample will produce very strange looking results.
                 (I think this is where SlipStream 5000 (a new 3D racing
                 game for the pc, there's a demo somewhere) breaks down.
                 Just fly close to a wall and move around a bit, it makes
                 me want to cry :^).
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
   3 : n-th order approximation.
       Here you do not linearly interpolate the texture coordinates (a
       first order approximation), instead you use a higher order of
       approximation. Usually, this means a quadratic approximation, where
       you pick a third point somewhere between the endpoints and "draw" a
       2nd order polynomial (a parabola) through these points. The
       mathematics of this are not completely straightforward, but they
       aren't exactly rocket-science either. If you want me to explain this
       in more detail, mail me, or, better yet, post here so others can read
       it as well.
       pro's : - very nice, clean implementation. Your inner loop can look
                 as simple as :
                 for (x=0; x &lt; dx; x++){
                   *screenptr++ = texture[u][v];
                              // well, ok, you'll have to round
                   u += du;   // u and v, but that's no real
                   v += dv;   // problem with fixed point math.
                   du += ddu;
                   dv += ddv;
                  }
               - (almost) as fast as approach 1).
       con's : - we're approximating a hyperbola by a parabola, so the
                 results will not be exact. (but pretty close, if you're
                 careful)
               - not so easy to pick a midpoint. It's not hard to formulate
                 in mathematical terms where the ideal midpoint is, but
                 calculating it in real time is very expensive, You can,
                 however, get quite good results with some simple rules.
</PRE>
<P>
These are not the only ways of doing it, but I haven't heard of another method
that will ge reasonable results at a reasonable frame rate.  All of these
approaches are approximating, i.e. will not look as good as the real thing,
but you can get pretty close.  At the moment, there is no realtime free
direction texturemapper for the pc, ppc, or any other "low-end" machine that
does do the divide, and some of them (descent, magic carpet...)  do look quite
good.
<P>
My personal favourite is approach nr. 3 (possibly combined with 2), although
this is probably because I like a clean, elegant, solution more than anything
else.  I've heard somewhere that Descent uses this approach, but I'm not sure
about this.
<P>
And while we're on the subject, these are just my ideas/opinions on the
subject, and while I don't think they are wildly of the mark, I don't think
they are 100% correct either.  If anyone sees things differently, just say so.

<P>
Linear interpolation with runs of 16 pixels seems to be the best trade off
between speed and image quality for perspective texture mapping using current
PCs.
