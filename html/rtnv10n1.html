Since the last issue (around February) much has happened, of course.  Beats me
what it could be, I've been too busy working.  Actually, a few things did pop
up above the noise level for me:  for example, the new POV-Ray 3.0 for Windows
is finally out, and the interface is pretty pleasant - beats using the command
line, at least for test images.  As for myself, instead of working on the Ray
Tracing News I have put my efforts into other areas.
<P>
The first and second issues of the "journal of graphics tools" are out; visit
<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/jgt">http://www.acm.org/jgt</A> for more info.  I'm one of ten editors for this refereed
journal, and I urge you all to consider submitting to it.  Personally, I would
like to see more short papers on specific, practical algorithms to perform
various tasks.  I believe most graphics programmers have a few tricks that have
not made it into the literature for one reason or another.  For example, if
you've ever written an article for comp.graphics.algorithms explaining some
technique, then you should consider contributing to jgt.  Because of its focus
on practical tools for graphics programmers, it is less formal that most other
journals in computer graphics.  Empirical proof (i.e. "as you can see, this
works") and usability of algorithms is more important here than formal proofs.
<P>
ACM TOG, <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/tog">http://www.acm.org/tog</A>, has actually caught up (its publishing
schedule had once been more than a year behind) and is back on schedule, due to
Andrew Glassner's fine whip hand and the suffering of numerous editorial board
members (not including me, I've just been webslaving for it).  Through the web
site we have been able to offer additional materials for articles printed in
TOG, such as MPEG movies showing algorithm behavior.  We have also started to
offer electronic versions of the latest TOG articles on an experimental basis.
Late breaking news:  Holly Rushmeier has taken over the Editor in Chief
position for TOG, as Andrew has become busy with Microsoft's MSNBC TV channel.
<P>
I have recently added new resource links to ACM TOG's web pages.  Under the
<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/tog/overview.html#resources">"Resources"</A>
area you will find a number of interesting new programs, such as
the GIMP (a free Photoshop-like program for Unix/Linux systems, with source
code and plug-in interface).  There are also links to other resources such as
bibliographies (I was amazed to learn the Computational Geometry bibliography
now has over 8000 entries), FAQs, links to on-line papers and tutorials, etc.
If you know of other resources on the Net that deserve a link, please tell me.
I am focussing on the better free resources directly useful to researchers and
educators; for example, programs listed on the web page generally have source
code available.
<P>
ACM TOG's site has also become the official home of two software resources, the
Graphics Gems code and the Standard Procedural Databases package.  I am the
archivist for the Gems code, logging bug fixes and maintaining the errata.
Craig Kolb has quietly and diligently provided a home for the Gems code base at
Princeton for years now.  His access to princeton.edu is becoming limited (he's
now at Stanford) and he is also in danger of graduating, so I have moved the
Gems code to <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/tog/GraphicsGems/">http://www.acm.org/tog/GraphicsGems/</A>.  The Standard Procedural
Databases code has also moved, to <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/tog/resources/SPD/">http://www.acm.org/tog/resources/SPD/</A>.  The
SPD is code which produces various databases for testing ray tracer efficiency.
Over the years Alexander Enzmann and others have added a wide variety of output
formats (e.g.  RenderMan, Wavefront OBJ, DXF) and translators.  The latest
release includes output into the VRML 2.0 and 3DMF file formats.
<P>
Also, I should note I've taken advantage of ACM's free membership benefit of
having an email address from which I can forward.  My new email address is
<A HREF="mailto:erich@acm.org">erich@acm.org</A>.  This is actually handy; for example, I can forward mail to my
free Juno email account during the Christmas vacation.  See
<A HREF="http://www.acm.org/account/">http://www.acm.org/account/</A> for details.
<P>
George Kyriazis is in Greece's army for a year, so I've taken over his duties
as maintainer of WUArchive's graphics archive site (ftp or
<A HREF="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics">http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics</A>).  "Benign neglect" has been my
mantra so far, unfortunately.  I would like to change this in the future,
updating the site with newer graphics software and information.  If you have
resources such as code or papers you would like to see available at WUArchive,
let me know.  It's a free way to keep your works alive at a permanent site.

BTW and FYI, there's no doubt a good TIA (Three Initial Acronym) API generator
could be made PDQ, IMO, given the existence of PCI, MMX, OLE, RDX, VFW, GDI,
RSX, OCX, ICM, MFC, and AGP (and that's only a small taste of what just
Microsoft and Intel have been up to).  Actually, we're running out of acronyms:
I just ran into two uses of STL (contest time:  be the first to tell me what
the two uses are and you win some random computer graphics CD laying on my
desk).
<P>
In the same vein, here is a trademark alert:  I recently noticed that the
phrase "Old Number 5" is trademarked (I forget by who), so remember, when you
use 5's, only use new ones.  And don't forget that "the color Pink is a
trademark of Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp.".
<P>
Lastly, something I keep forgetting to mention:  if you're a C coder, check out
"Obfuscated C and Other Mysteries" by Don Libes, Wiley Books.  I bought this on
a lark with some book credit money I had, and it's one of the best things I
ever got.  The Obfuscated C contest winning programs are interesting, of
course; I'm in awe of the program that solves differential equations and
reverses code, and when applied to its own code creates a sort program, which
when again applied to itself creates a Fibonacci sequence generator (no, I
can't explain it better - check out
<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/csp/ioccc/index.html">
http://reality.sgi.com/csp/ioccc/index.html</A>
for the Obfuscated C contest results,
<A HREF="http://reality.sgi.com/csp/ioccc/1990/theorem.hint">
http://reality.sgi.com/csp/ioccc/1990/theorem.hint</A>
for the program description).  However,
some of the explanations of the code in these programs drag on.  What's great
about this book is all the "stuff they never taught you in school" techniques
presented.  There are some excellent pieces on allocating memory faster than
malloc does, about efficient bit flag array creation and access, about signals,
and many other topics which are useful for efficient and effective programming.

I have done ray tracing for about 7 years as a small fraction of my time.  I
apply RT to the calculation of radar cross section (electromagnetic scattering)
for aircraft.  I use the '3D billiards' techniques of ray tracing for tracking
ray bounces on a geometrical model.  My principal objects are parametric
bicubic patches (PBCs) & flat facets.  I use the point in polygon algorithm for
general facets and the 3 planes algorithm for triangular facets.  I use 2
dimensional Newton-Raphson for intersection tests on the PBCs and SEADS for
geometry walk through.  I optionally use 2 levels of SEADS for reducing memory
requirements when memory is limited.
<P>
Since about 1989 I have used a technique for PBC tracing similar to Rick
Turner's (<A HREF="rtnv4n3.html#art5">RTNews Nov 18 '91</A>)
where I subdivide my PBCs.  This technique yields
SpeedIndeed.  Normally, the volume of the bounding boxes encompassing the
subdivisions is much less than the volume of a single bounding box containing
the entire surface.  Further, knowing which subdivision is being tested
provides a better starting point to begin 2D Newton-Raphson.
<P>
With this logic, my ray tracer is only 3 to 6 times slower on curved surface
geometry than on a comparable faceted model.  This is measured on a geometry
where the bounces are not between close neighbors.  Staying with the original
surfaces also increases my accuracy relative to triangulating.  Are any RTNews
readers getting better speeds than this?  DOES ANYBODY HAVE FAST ASSEMBLY
LANGUAGE for 4by4 matrix multiplies (either double or single precision) on the
following machines:

result: 1 * less and nothing more. Not so good as the previous one but
there is no operation added.
<P>
____
<P>
[We also discussed light passing through colored transmitting objects and how
to best control it. -EAH]
<P>
It appears that there is two ways for filtering colors.
<P>
1) the first solution is, as you say, filter by the color of the object and
then the formula looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>
  result_color = kt * light_color * object_color
</PRE>
<P>
Of course, if you don't want the filtering color you have to put the
object_color to white.
<P>
2) the second solution is the one used by Softimage, for example.  As kt goes
to 1.0, the object disappears.  So, even if you have defined the object as red,
the object will be invisible and there will be no filtering effect at all.
<P>
<PRE>
  result_color = kt * (kt * light_color + (1-kt) * object_color)
</PRE>
<P>
[A somewhat surprising formula, since there's a kt*kt term in there. -EAH]
<P>
An analogous problem appears with illumination models:
<P>
One use additive formulation, another (softimage) use multiplicative
formulation:
<P>
<PRE>
  result_color = local_color + ks * reflected_color + kt * refracted_color
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
  result_color = (1-kt) * ((1-ks) * local_color + ks * reflected_color) +
                  kt * refracted_color
</PRE>
<P>
In the second solution, refraction is dominant.
<P>
I don't know what is better, but I think you are right.  It's more easy to
control the transparencies with the first solution:  combining kt and the
object's color.  Maybe this is more difficult when the object is mapped because
the object's color is given by the map and if you want a small color
attenuation you have to transform all the map (to white)?
<P>
[Personally, I use a method between these two methods: things like diffuse and
ambient and reflection get scaled by Kt, but the specular highlight does not.
This makes it easier to control the highlight (which is a hack, anyway - you
should really be reflecting the light source itself). -EAH]
<P>
By the way, when working on the special effects for the movie "The City of The
Lost Children" a problem arose:  When you compose a computer generated image on
a real image you use a mask (alpha plane) for object occlusions.  But what is
the correct solution for mixing the object's shadows, too, and the reflection
of that object on mirrors...  We can do it all in a single image but we have
never seen articles about such processes to know if we are wrong or right.
<P>
[I sort of understand this problem.  Compositing is definitely a pain:  for
example, it's common to allow a texture map to act as a backdrop which fills
the background.  However, this backdrop has no physical location in the scene,
so if you put a reflective or refractive object in the scene the map is not
seen.  Usually no big deal if you also just use the backdrop as a
reflection/refraction map used when nothing else is hit, or perhaps actually
give the texture a real location in space.  -EAH]
<P>
____
<P>
Paul Heckbert (Paul.Heckbert@HOSTESS.GRAPHICS.CS.CMU.EDU) comments:
<P>
Yes, that is a nice little improvement.  And I guess we would have to call it
Bec's method!
<P>
As far as translucency, I suggest a formula like:
<P>
<PRE>
        final_color = transparency*light_color + (1-transparency)*filter_color
</PRE>
<P>
where transparency = exp(-alpha*thickness)
<P>
and alpha is a parameter something like kt, controlling how much scattering
there is, and thickness is the distance the ray travels through the transparent
object.
<P>
I think you'll find formulas analogous to that in many computer graphics books.

Results of Sphere in Box Ratio Contest,
</A></FONT>
by Han-Wen Nienhuys (<A HREF="mailto:hanwen@stack.nl">hanwen@stack.nl</A>), Jim Arvo (arvo@cs.caltech.edu), and Eric Haines
</H4>
Here is the problem, as stated last issue:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
        I have another problem, again a useful result for ray tracing:  what is
        the average cross-sectional area of the projection of a sphere vs. a
        bounding box around the sphere?  In other words, given a sphere in a
        bounding box, what is the chance that an arbitrary ray (originating
        outside the bounding box) hitting the box will also hit the sphere?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The answer turns out to be the ratio between the sphere's surface area and the
bounding box's area.  In fact, surprisingly, the chance of hitting any convex
object with a random ray is proportional to its surface area.  Goldsmith &
Salmon's automatic bounding volume hierarchy article was the first place I
heard of this theorem, but I hadn't seen a proof, so I asked around.
<P>
________
<P>
From: Jim Arvo (<A HREF="mailto:arvo@cs.caltech.edu">arvo@cs.caltech.edu</A>)
<P>
To answer your question, yes, the average projected area of a convex body is
1/4 its surface area.  You can check out my SIGGRAPH course notes from 1990 for
a (nearly) rigorous proof, or almost any book on geometric probability.  I gave
at least one reference to the theorem in my chapter of the ray tracing book.
The 1990 course notes are not available on my web page yet, but they will be as
soon as I find the file!!!  I'm such a pack rat I know I have it somewhere!
<P>
[And indeed he found it, check out <A HREF="http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~arvo/papers.html">http://www.cs.caltech.edu/~arvo/papers.html</A>
and get the "Ray Tracing with Meta-Hierarchies" paper.  There are other great
ray tracing (and other) papers here which have appeared only in course notes or
hard to find proceedings, e.g. "The Ray Tracing Kernel" and "Backward Ray
Tracing".  -EAH]

<P>
It turned out that the first entry I received won:
<P>
From: Han-Wen Nienhuys (<A HREF="mailto:hanwen@stack.nl">hanwen@stack.nl</A>)
<A HREF="http://www.stack.nl/~hanwen">http://www.stack.nl/~hanwen</A>
<P>
I'm not sure this is what you want, but the expectancy of the area of a
projection of any convex object compared to the area of its surface is a fixed
ratio.  The ratio can be easily calculated, take a sphere:
<P>
<PRE>
 projection:    pi R^2
 object area: 4 pi R^2
</PRE>
<P>
ratio: 1/4
<P>
The area of the boundingbox is 6*(2*R)^2, =24*R^2 and the expected area of the
projection is 24*R^2/4=6R^2, so the ratio of sphereprojection vs.
cubeprojection is pi/6.
<P>
I am just doing this from the top of my head.  Last year's Dutch University
Mathematics Competition had a similar question (expected area of an isotropic
projection of a cube).
<P>
The answer suggested partitioning the convex object in triangles and then
proving the theorem for arbitrary triangles.
<P>
The idea is this (let ExpArea be the expected area of a projection along a
isotropically distributed direction, and "f" is the ratio we are trying to
find):
<P>
1. For any triangle T.
<P>
<PRE>
   ExpArea(T) = f * Area(T)
</PRE>
<P>
f does not depend on T.
<P>
2. For any convex polytope (made of triangles T_i)
<P>
<PRE>
  P = Union_i T_i
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
So ExpArea(P) = ExpArea(Union T_i) = Sum_i ExpArea(T_i)
  = Sum_i f*Area(T_i) = f * Area(Union_i T_i)
  = f * Area(P)
</PRE>
<P>
(maybe I am losing a factor 2 somewhere, because a convex set has back
and/or front side. It doesn't matter, any factors will be absorbed in f)
<P>
3. If C is a convex object, it can be approximated by a triangularization
P, so
<P>
<PRE>
ExpArea(C) = ExpArea(P) = f*Area(P) = f * Area(C)
           ~                        ~
</PRE>
<P>
The triangles can be made smaller, and the approximations (~) will be
better. In the limit,
<P>

I know that this is only a so-so proof (if it is worth the name), step 1 and
especially step 3 would involve some advanced math, but this is how you would
prove it elegantly.
<P>
The result also generalizes to lower (2) and higher dimensions.
<P>
________
<P>
In case you didn't follow that, here's a talk through:
<P>
To state this a little more loosely, step one says that an arbitrary triangle
and its average projected area have a constant ratio.  This could use a little
more proof, as he says, but here's an intuitive way to know that this is true.
First, this is definitely true for the class of all equilateral triangles -
there is some answer to what the average projected area is for some one
equilateral triangle, and scaling up this equilateral triangle to a different
size won't change the ratio "f" between the new area and new average projected
area.  So, now make an arbitrary triangle out of a million tiny equilateral
triangles; sure, the edges won't be perfect (add another billion tiny
triangles, then, i.e.  take it to the limit) but the point is that the ratio
"f" for equilateral triangles then applies to arbitrary triangles (or any 2D
figure, in fact).  So, now we informally know step 1 is true, that "f" is a
constant.
<P>
Step 2 says that a convex object made of polygons will have a constant "f"
ratio, too, same as in step 1.  This is because from any angle, no part of the
object covers another forward facing part of the object (it's convex).  So, you
can sum up all the triangles' areas since they do not interfere with each
other.
<P>
Step 3 is sort of like my step 1 informal proof: it says that any convex
object (e.g. curved) can be tessellated into triangles, something I think we
all believe.
<P>
Step 4 is the clever part:  a sphere is a convex object, and the nice thing
about a sphere is that its projected area is the same from any direction.  So
now we simply work backward through the steps.  For a sphere the projected area
vs.  the surface area is 1/4th, so "f" must be 1/4, and since we proved this
"f" is constant we now know that it holds for all convex objects, so we can
compute the answer to the problem in Step 5.  If this proof seems bass-ackwards
to you, check Arvo's paper for a formal integration of the projected area of an
arbitrary triangle.  I personally like the (looser) proof as is, since we never
had to even integrate to prove it.
<P>
Note that the value of 1/4th is for a convex 3D object.  The ratio is 1/2 for
an arbitrary 2D figure's average projected area to its actual area (because we
do not compute its actual area by adding its front area to its backface area),
if both sides of the 2D figure are visible (i.e.  no culling).
<P>
This result is handy for all sorts of things.  Goldsmith and Salmon use it to
compute a cost function for the relative chances of hitting a bounding volume,
so helping them to optimize their hierarchy.  Or, say you want to test a
graphics rasterizer by tossing arbitrarily oriented polygons on the screen
which will cover an average of 50 pixels each.  By this theorem you know that
(using a parallel projection) the triangles need to cover 100 pixels when
viewed straight on.

hadn't hit yet - it's great to get a warning of what to watch out for, sort of
an "FBI's Most Wanted" list of rogues.  Their "poor texture interpolation" bug
(where a textured quadrilateral with one short side is badly rendered if split
into two triangles) actually has an interesting limiting case:  a tessellation
of a cone.  A good textured cone tessellation needs to have quadrilaterals for
the faces, not triangles:  at the cone tip you need two vertices, with the XYZ
locations identical but the normals and texture coordinates different.  Systems
which show textures by splitting up quads into triangles and rendering these
will improperly display such quadrilaterals.

The short summary is: automatic bounding volume hierarchy with grids at each

nice to see some serious ray tracing efficiency research still being done, and
the techniques and results are interesting and well-presented.  Even if you
just use grids, their section on setting the resolution of grids is a nice
take-away (the gist is an idea I've heard of before, but I don't recall seeing
in print: instead of giving a box of dimensions of say 1,4,9 a constant
grid resolution along each axis, instead scale the resolutions proportionally
with the box's dimensions.  Timing results are given showing this to be a
better method.)

Synthetic Textures and Genetic Algorithms,
</A></FONT>
by Steve Worley (<A HREF="mailto:steve@worley.com">steve@worley.com</A>)
</H4>
[Steve and I had a long email exchange on this topic.  In my last note to him I
was discussing Sims-like methods of generating synthetic textures (use genetic
algorithms to combine equations, with the observer picking which equation
survives to the next generation) and bemoaning the fact that minor evolutionary
changes in equations usually caused huge textural changes.  Such large changes
mean that you have little sense of being in control of the process, and so
there is little sense of steering generations towards more interesting and
appealing results.  Contrast this to Latham's work, where you get a strong
sense of ancestry if you look through the choices you made in evolving a
strange 3D creature.  BTW, there is now a fantastic screen saver program for
Windows 95 which Latham worked on, check it out at <A HREF="http://www.artworks.co.uk/">http://www.artworks.co.uk/</A>.
--EAH]
<P>
You make a great point about the fickleness of genetic algorithms.  One problem
is that if you the human need to judge each image, you have to see all these
garbage tests.  Using some automatic quality selection algorithm instead will
prune for you, so while the generation effort is still wasted, it's automatic
and you just let things cook a bit longer.  But as we said, the quality of
texture is more a human subjective thing.  We need to stay in the loop!  Here a
fast CPU is still good for fast updates so the human can make their choices
faster I guess...
<P>
But a more promising method of using genetic algorithms is to limit their
scope.  By feeding in a set of very complex primitives, simple combinations can
make new and impressive surfaces using only simple combinations.  Consider the
impossibility of making a fractal noise cloudy surface with a genetic algorithm
that can do only + - / *, if, and floor.  It just wouldn't happen, though those
operations are sufficient.  But when it has noise() as a primitive, magic can
happen!
<P>
So I see a way in which say a limited number of complex primitives (say two
fractal noises, a sawtooth, and a radial ramp) and a limited number of simple
operations (+-/* if..  sin,) get mixed together, with rules to prevent
super-concatenation.  3*noise(x)+x+noise(sawtooth(x)) is fine, but
sawtooth(noise(x+4*sin(noise(radial(x+1))))) is not.  Maybe even limit it to
simple binomial combinations.
<P>
The idea of this is that by limiting the genetic forms, you can limit the
complexity of the textures (keeping them efficient) and you also limit the
number of changes that can occur during a mutation or breeding.  You give up
some of the rich number of possible surfaces you might get by surprise, but the
extra control may be reasonable.  Have you used Kai's Power Tools texture
explorer?  It seems to have only a very few base algorithms, with only a few
controls, though they also use a large selection of spline color maps.  It's
not overly complex, yet people play with it for hours.
<P>
Another aspect of genetic algorithms is perhaps more interesting.  Forget
changing the ALGORITHM, take any current man-made texture.  Nearly all are
driven by a list of parameters like "turbulence value" or "scale size", etc.
What set of parameters looks best?  Answer:  jiggle a test test of parameters
some way and let the user pick images until these parameters get set to some
local user maximum happiness value.  I mention this a bit in the postscript of
my chapter in the texturing book.  There's something to this.  I don't know
just how to do it yet.  But it'd be very useful, both for end user as well as
for developer.
<P>
[and here's another interesting bit from another note from Steve. -EAH]
<P>
My main idea is that the algorithm for choosing the new parameters is not
obvious, and depending on the application it may even vary.  So I may write a
METAalgorithm which basically has a bunch of methods to try.  It tries them all
and notices which ones tend to make better pictures (as scored by the user).
Then it starts using those selection methods more often.  This can happen
adaptively even as the user plays around.  Maybe at first the user is just
exploring, looking for many different types of appearances, until he finds a
cool one he wants to refine.  Suddenly his goals change; he wants one that's
"like THAT but better", as opposed to "something cool not like these".  Anyway,
just a long-deferred project.  I haven't thought about it for a year or so.

Ray Tracing, What is it Good For?
</A></FONT>
by Arijan Siska (<A HREF="mailto:arijan@kette.fer.uni-lj.si">arijan@kette.fer.uni-lj.si</A>)
</H4>
I'm using 3DS a lot these days (in my own animation company (got my degree in
December)), and believe me I sure do not miss the slowness of raytracing.  And
it also seems that most of the reflections can be faked with automatic
reflection maps (ones that get rendered on actual scene prior to the rendering
of the real picture).
<P>
Basically I've compiled a list of reasons why would one use raytracing at all.
Here it goes:
<OL>
<LI>
Exact primitives (spheres & ...) - can be faked on scanconversion
algorithm with adaptive subdivision based on pixel coverage.
<LI>
No problem shadows. Wide lights (real softshadows).
<LI>
Heightfields are supposed to be easier to trace than scanconvert zillions
of polygons.
<LI>
CSG objects.
<LI>
Extended camera models (cylindrical camera, spherical camera (fisheye) & ...)
<LI>
Easy & real reflection & refraction
</OL>
<P>
I doubt these (or other) reasons will ever push scanline based renderers like
3DS out of the picture.
<P>
Real world animation (visualization, games, ...)  will always need faster
results even with god knows how fast machines, academic research will without a
doubt move to global methods like path tracing and particle tracing.
<P>
There is no easy (cheap) way to avoid aliasing in raytracing.  This is going to
be a dominating factor when raytracing moves (and it will, I'm sure) into
mainstream production software.  In production, quality is very important.

Fast Soft Shadows,

by Steve Worley
</H4>
[a fragment of a note from Steve.  This is an idea I've thought about and
always wanted to try but never got around to do - nice to hear it actually
works pretty well!  Sure, it might not catch the soft shadows all the time just
due to bad luck, but for the most part I can imagine it working.  -EAH]
<P>
...a neat sampling scheme specifically for soft shadows.  If a pixel is in
shadow but its neighbor is not, both are sampled even more.  If one of the
pixels is in PARTIAL shadow, its neighbors are also sampled more.  Pass #1
basically uses a single sample per pixel, but it identifies any shadow
boundaries.  The recursive "fill" algorithm used in pass #2 helps a lot since
it works very hard on the soft areas but doesn't fire much more in solid light
or solid dark regions.  It worked surprisingly well.  I meant to do the same
for depth of field, but it was trickier and I never got around it.  However, I
really find the shadow "area growth" sampling to work exceedingly well; looking
at a grey scale image of the number of samples taken for each pixel, the soft
shadow regions are easily noticed.
<P>
This is good; you only do the horrible soft shadow work where the shadow
really is soft.

Progressive Ray Tracing and Fast Previews,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines
</H4>
Here's an interesting form of progressive ray tracing:  you first render
everything at say 8x8 resolution and toss gouraud shaded polygons on the
screen, using the samples to generate 8x8 sized polygons to toss to the screen.
Then you look for large differences and resolve them.  My system started with
the 8x8's spiralling outwards from the middle of the picture (since the
interesting stuff is usually at the center), then resolved on a variety of
different types of corner comparisons:  did the objects at the corners differ?
Did the shadows change state?  Did the colors differ?  etc.  Just doing color
differences was not good enough, as you would waste a lot of time refining
textures when what you really would rather have seen was object boundaries.
Whenever a sample was refined, its neighbors would also be put in the queue so
that, while you watched, an entire object or shadow edge would resolve itself.
It was nice, in that you'd get a 95% good sphereflake, for example, in 1/10th
the rendering time.  As a bonus, you'd actually get somewhat soft reflections
for awhile during the process (since reflective areas were not refined first,
so they would be represented by gouraud blends of their samples).
<P>
As discussed in <A HREF="rtnv8n2.html#art11">RTNv8n2</A>, this "soft reflection" idea can actually be used in
object space (instead of image space, as above).  Microcosm (reviewed in

Free Radiosity Renderer (inc. C++ source code),
</A></FONT>
by Ian Ashdown (<A HREF="mailto:iashdown@ledalite.com">iashdown@ledalite.com</A>)
</H4>
The C++ source code for HELIOS, a fully-functional radiosity renderer for
MS-Windows 3.1, is now available for downloading on the 'net ...
<P>
"Radiosity" is a computer graphics technique that enables you to synthesize
photorealistic images.  Whereas ray tracing techniques excel in the rendition
of point light sources, specular reflections, and refraction effects, radiosity
methods accurately model area light sources, diffuse reflections, color
bleeding between surfaces, and detailed shading within shadows.  They are in a
sense complementary approaches to photorealistic rendering.
<P>
Folklore had it that you needed a graphics workstation with gigabytes of RAM or
even a supercomputer to do radiosity rendering.  This is no longer true:  You
can use your personal desktop computer -- a '386 IBM-PC with a math
coprocessor, 4 MB of RAM, and a 256-color SVGA display will do nicely -- to
experiment with radiosity methods.  A 66-MHz '486DX machine will render a
simple scene (540 polygons) in less than three minutes.  A more complex scene
with 2,700 polygons can be rendered in a little over six minutes.
<P>
Commercial radiosity renderers are slowly making their way into the
marketplace.  Take a look, for example, at the incomparable Lightscape
Visualization system (<A HREF="http://www.lightscape.com">http://www.lightscape.com</A>) to see what is available now
for Windows NT.  (Other interesting sites on the Web for commercial radiosity
renderers are <A HREF="http://www.bentley.com/products/masterpiece/">http://www.bentley.com/products/masterpiece/</A> -- download the

This book provides a detailed explanation of radiosity theory and its
associated algorithms (no knowledge of higher mathematics required!)  More
important, it also includes complete, fully documented, and
compiler-independent C++ source code (over 7,500 lines) for HELIOS Version
1.00A, a fully-functional radiosity- based rendering program for MS-Windows
3.1, Windows 95, and Windows NT.
<P>
The radiosity-related code presented in the book is identical to that now
offered online.  If you want to fully understand how HELIOS (and radiosity)
works, you more or less need to buy the book.

New Books,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines
</H4>
One thing I've been doing for a little money is review book proposals and
technical edit book drafts.  I could probably make a better hourly wage at
McDonald's, but the concept that someone is actually paying me to read
something that I want to read anyway is great (don't tell any editors that, or
my wages drop).
<P>
Two books I've worked on last year are Keith Rule's
<A HREF="http://www.aw.com/devpress/titles/48835.html">
"3D Graphic File Formats: A Programmers Reference"</A>,
Addison-Wesley (see <A HREF="http://www.europa.com/~keithr/">http://www.europa.com/~keithr/</A>)
and and Bridget Testa Mintz' "Graphical Treasures of the Internet", Academic
Press (<A HREF="http://www.apnet.com/">http://www.apnet.com/</A>).
I've also done some editing for parts of Rob
Glidden's "Graphics Programming with Direct3D:  Techniques and Concepts,"
Addison-Wesley.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.aw.com/devpress/titles/48835.html">
"3D Graphic File Formats"</A>
is about the only book in its field.  Murray and
vanRyper's "Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats" is about the only book that
comes close at this point, and their volume is primarily about image file
formats.  Rule's book discusses VRML 1.0, DXF, 3DS, Wavefront OBJ, TrueSpace,
WTK-NFF, POV-Ray 2.2, and RAW formats.  For most readers Rule provides
something no other book does:  a working program for reading and writing each
of these 3D formats and translating from one to another.  It is written in C++,
with a Windows framework to read/view/write models, along with an OCX custom
control.  The CD ROM also includes over 100 models not normally found on the
web and trial versions of TriSpectives and TrueSpace.  The best thing about the
book:  the DXF format is explained in English, not tech-ese.  Credit for this
accomplishment is shared by Rule and Zap Andersson, who has worked with the
format for years.
<P>
Some limitations of the book should be mentioned.  First, the software converts
basic geometry, but currently does not support translations of surface vertex
normals (i.e. any smoothing information is lost when moving between formats)
or texture coordinates.  It also does not have a serious polygon tessellator.
So, you may have to get a professional translation program (Syndesis'
InterChange, Okino's Polytrans, etc), for higher quality translations.  Also,
the book is not meant to be the final word on each specification; much of the
book is dedicated to explaining how the software works, not how the format
works.  However, given the page limitations, this book is quite a feat.  It is
more than adequate for those who want to get under the hood and understand
various 3D file formats, and for those who want to convert from their own file
formats to others.  Adding new format readers and writers is a fairly
straightforward process; usually one of the formats Rule covers is similar to
what you want to add, so that code can simply be regrooved to read in the new
format.
<P>
Mintz' "Graphical Treasures of the Internet" is on the non-technical end of the
spectrum.  While a fair bit of the book is dedicated to explaining to beginners
many of the basics of Internet, commercial services, and non-commercial
alternatives (and I would bet that almost no one has tried all the resources
she covers), there is also a fair bit of meat about other topics.  There are
interviews with a number of well-known computer graphics and Internet people
and many different perspectives are presented.  Personally, I found the chapter
on copyright and software patents particularly interesting; it was something I
felt confident passing on to our company lawyer for his own edification.  There
is also information here found nowhere else.  For example, she presents a
history of the comp.graphics.* hierarchy back as far as could be done.  Mintz
is an engineer turned professional writer, and it shows:  this book is both
well-written and well-informed.
<P>
Glidden's
<A HREF="http://www.aw.com/devpress/titles/56173.html">
"Graphics Programming with Direct3D"</A>, from Addison-Wesley
(<A HREF="http://www.aw.com/">http://www.aw.com/</A>)
is a pleasure to read, which is surprising given that the
topic sounds dry as can be.  His book talks about the place of 3D in the
marketplace, motion capture, how to manage multi-user spaces, and other
interesting topics which do not directly bear on the topic of Direct3D.  The
author is a long-time technical reporter on computer graphics and related
topics, so his prose is readable and he can't resist commenting on many aspects
of the field.  He gives a great top-level view of various areas of the field,
along with solid advice on Direct3D, e.g. whether to go with retained mode vs.
immediate mode.  There is also some information on 3D file formats such as
DirectX, DXF, and 3DS, on the basics of 3D vector math, and on the fundamentals
of graphics PC hardware.  Given that the Direct3D API is still in flux (e.g.
today I read how a new command, DrawTriangle, was just added to it), it means
to me that this book actually could have a longer life-span than could be
expected, as Glidden's discussions on more than just the nitty-gritty of using
D3D will last well beyond the next beta release.
<P>
Many other books came out during 1996, of course.  API books were a
noticeable trend, witness
<A HREF="http://heg-school.aw.com/cseng/authors/leler/3d/3d.html">
"3D with HOOPS"</A>
by William Leier and Jim Merry,
Addison-Wesley, with a CD-ROM with a personal version of the HOOPS library for
the Mac, Unix, and Windows.  Such software used to cost hundreds, if not
thousands, of dollars for a single person license, but in the new market for
mind-share prices have dropped.  Same story for "Learn 3D Graphics Programming
on the PC" by Richard Ferraro, Addison-Wesley, which is essentially a nicely
done explanation
of 3D graphics using the RenderWare API and includes a personal copy on CD-ROM
- again, a few years ago a personal copy of this software would cost you about
$1000.
<P>
Certainly of note is
<A HREF="http://literary.com/mkp/pages/3875/index.html">"Jim Blinn's Corner"</A>,
from Morgan Kaufmann Publishers
(<A HREF="http://www.mkp.com/">http://www.mkp.com/</A>).
Finally, many of Blinn's IEEE CG&A column articles are assembled in one place.
I personally wish they had just gone for it and published all 45 of his columns
to date, but having these 20 in one place saves me a lot of flipping through
old issues of CG&A.  In case you've been missing out on this column, think
"Graphics Gems" meets "Programming Pearls".  Each chapter is around 10 pages
long and focusses on a particular topic, like "How Many Ways Can You Draw A
Circle?", "Subpixelic Particles", and "Backface Culling Snags".  There is a lot
of useful "here's what I think is the best/fastest/cleanest way to do this"
type of advice.  If you're a graphics programmer, why you don't have this book
I cannot imagine.
<P>
What else is new?  Well, there's a second edition of Murray & vanRyper's
<A HREF="http://www.ora.com/catalog/gffcd/">
"Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats"</A>, from O'Reilly,
(<A HREF="http://www.ora.com/">http://www.ora.com/</A>),
which has bulked out a
bit more with information on new formats like PNG and more on 3D file formats
like 3DS.  I still consider this primarily a 2D file format book (esp. now
that Rule's book is out), but it's definitely the first place I look for
information on such formats.  Other than that, hmmm, I haven't gone wild buying
new books this year I guess.  There are a ton of new books on specific topics
(e.g. I'd guess around 50+ on just VRML itself), but nothing else pops out at
me as of general interest - if you know anything good I've missed, let me know!
<P>
Another book of note is Watkins & Mallette's
<A HREF="http://www.charlesriver.com/multgrph.html#spt">
"Stereogram Programming Techniques"</A>, from Charles River Media
(<A HREF="http://www.charlesriver.com/">http://www.charlesriver.com/</A>).
I beat this topic to death in <A HREF="rtnv8n1.html#art11">RTNv8n1</A>,
reviewing two books in the process, so I have to admit that I've only skimmed
through this new volume (the fad's past, right?  Stereogram pictures are
destined to be remembered as the black light posters of the 90's).  This new
entry in the field looks pretty good: it stresses the theory and programming
behind the technique, and there's no hidden agenda to sell you any additional
software.  This book is considerably longer that the other two books I reviewed
(it's about 450 pages), and so can take its time in presenting theory, code
listings, etc.  The stress is put on stereo pairs, SIRDS, and SIS (i.e. there
are no text stereograms).  All in all, it looks good, and also points the
reader at other articles and resources.

Tastes vary, and I disagree with a few of his reviews, but the great thing for
me was to hear about some books I've never even run across.  Such a list gives
you a chance to get some titles to page through at the bookstore and see if
they look worthwhile (Also, there are some interesting HTML pages on Direct3D
and OpenGL under the "publications" category at this site, if you're in to
such things).
