        Well, this has been a busy time around here.  First of all, note my
change of address (it's in the header).  We've moved to a larger building with
much better environmental controls (i.e. we don't have to cool the machines in
the winter by opening the windows).  In the meantime I've been trying to
actually finish a product and maybe even make some money from it.  There's
also those SIGGRAPH deadlines on January 10th....  Busy times, so excuse the
long delay in getting this issue out.
<P>
        The other great struggle has been to try to get my new Cornell account
to talk with the outside world.  DEC's EUNICE operating system has foiled me so
far, so this issue is being distributed by Michael Cohen, who's now at the
University of Utah.  Many thanks, Michael.
<P>
        Due to the length between issues, my cullings from USENET have
accumulated into an enormous amount of material.  As such, the condensed
version of these will be split between this and the next issue.  This issue
contains what I felt was the best of the supersampling discussion.  If this
material is old hat, please write and tell us of your experiences with
supersampling: what algorithm do you use? are you satisfied with it? what kind
of filtering is used, and what are your subdivision criteria?
<P>
        This issue is the first one that has a "Volume X, Number Y" in the
header.  This has been added partly for ease of reference, but also (more
importantly) for avoiding dropouts.  If you get "Number 1", then "Number 3",
you know you've missed something (probably due to email failure).  At the end
of this issue is a list of all the past issues.  If you are missing any, please
write and I'll send them on.

        My interests in ray tracing are in multi-process (networks of SUNS, BBN
Butterfly, and Transputers) ray tracing, space subdivision, and ray tracing
functionally defined iso-surfaces.
<P>
        I am working on optimistic multi-processor ray tracing and combining
adaptive and voxel spatial subdivision techniques.  I have implemented a
parallel ray tracer on the University of Calgary's BBN Butterfly.  My ray
tracers handle a variety of object types including polygons, spline surfaces,
and functionally defined iso-surfaces.  My latest projects are using TimeWarp
to speed up multi-processor ray tracing, adding a texture language, frame
coherence for ray tracing animation, and developing the ray tracing answer to
radiosity.

<P>
I am relatively new the field of ray tracing. I am involved in the design of a
raycasting system based on the original design by Gershon Kedem and John Ellis
[Proc. 1984 Int'l conference on Computer Design]. The original design uses
Constructive Solid Geometry for building up a complex object out of simple
primitives like cones, cylinders, and spheres. The main drawback of such a
system is that representing an object with cubic or higher order surfaces
require numerous quadratic primitives and even then is at best an approximation
to the original surface.
<P>
The raycasting machine uses an array of parallel rays and intersects them with
primitives. The applications of such a machine are potentially large like:
modeling surfaces for NC machines, calculating volume and moment of inertia,
finding fast surface intersections, to name just a few. At present there are 2
working models of the raycasting machine, one of which is in the Dept. of
Mechanical Engg. at Cornell. The other one is our experimental m/c which is
located at the U. of N. Carolina at Chapel Hill (The operative word in this
sentence is "located" :-) ). Although my input may not be very frequent at the
beginning I will be an avid reader of the raycasting news. Thanks for inviting
me in.

At Duke we have designed a system that does ray casting on many primitives in
parallel.  This is achieved with 2 types of processors, a primitive classifier
(PC) and a combine classifier (CC).  The PC's solve systems of quadratic
equations and the CC's combine these results.

I am the system software person, I am writing micro code for an Adage 3000
machine.  The micro code is responsible for controlling the ray casting board

ABSTRACT
<P>
The proposed research aims at an  efficient  system  architecture
and  improved  algorithms  for realistic visualization of complex
scenes described by parametric surfaces.
<P>
The  key  components  of such  a  system are a spatial index  and
a surface patch intersector.  For both very efficient  uniproces-
sor  solutions  have  been developed  by the authors at the  Hel-
sinki  University  of  Technology.  However, to obtain sufficient
speed, at least the latter should be based on a specialized   ar-
chitecture.
<P>
We  propose obtaining a balanced complete system by gradually as-
cending  what we call a specialization hierarchy.   At its bottom
are solutions based on multiprocessors or networks of independent
computing units (transputers). In this case an important research
problem is how to avoid duplicating the data base in the  proses-
sors. At  the top of the hierarchy are specialized processors im-
plemented in VLSI.
<P>
The research will produce general insight into the  possibilities
of    utilizing  concurrency   and   specialized   processors  in
geometric search and computation.

[a later message from Markku Tamminen:]
<P>
I thought I'd send this summary of responses as feedback, because some answers
may not have found their way through the network. I think mit@hutcs.hut.fi
might be the safest address to use for me.
<P>
Our project has not yet started - I have just applied for funding with the
proposal whose abstract I sent to you. Also, I am a software person, but hope
to get somebody hardware-oriented involved in the project. We will be using
transputers to start with, but so far I have just made some small experiments
with them.
<P>
Our ray/patch intersection method is based on subdivision. It is a new method
developed by Charles Woodward, and quite a bit more efficient than Whitted's
original one. However, it takes 3 ms for a complete ray/patch intersection on a
SUN4. Thus, we'd like to develop a specialized processor for this task - the
algorithm is well suited for that.
<P>
Our spatial index is EXCELL, which I originally published in 1981, and whose 3D
application was described in SIGGRAPH'83 by Martti Mantyla and me. I have
lately tuned it quite a bit for ray-tracing, and we are very satisfied with its
performance. (EXCELL uses octree-like, but binary, subdivision. It has a
directory, which is an array providing direct access by address computation,
and a data part, which corresponds to the leaf cells of an octree. Binary
subdivision leads to fewer leaf-cells than 8-way. There is an overflow
criterion that decides when subdivision will be discontinued.)
<P>
We have obtained best results when we store in the spatial index for each patch
the bounding box of its control points, and further cut it with a "slab"
defined by two planes parallel to a "mean normal" of the patch. Using this
method we have to perform, on the average, less than 2 complete patch/ray
intersection tests.
<P>
Our method has not been as efficient as that of subdividing the patches to all
the way to triangles. However, as much less storage is required, we consider
our technique more suited for distributed architectures.
<P>
In the proposed project we want to look both into developing a specialized
(co)processor for the ray/patch intersection task and into distributing the
whole computation on several processors. I think that the most difficult
research problem is the partitioning of the data base in a loosely coupled
system. In our case the ray/patch intersection task is so time consuming that
it would help (to begin with) to keep the ray/database traversal on the
workstation and jost distribute the intersection task to other processors.
<P>
Some questions:
<P>

    as a continuation of Pulleyblank & Kapenga's article in CG&A?

I would like you to bring this to the attention of the RT news group (if you

<P>
There are lots of conference proceedings and journals other than SIGGRAPH &
CG&A which contain ray tracing articles. At least, here, at our university we
don't get all those journals (for example, the Visual Computer) due to budget
constraints.  It would be nice for someone to post relevant articles on ray
tracing so that all of us will be aware of the work going on in ray tracing
every where. For instance, I have found several articles in the Visual Computer
that were relevant to what I was doing after being pointed at by someone else.
If these can be listed by someone who gets these journals, then it would make
it easier to get access to these articles.

Subject:  Transforming normals
</PRE>
<P>
Was skimming the back issues of the RT News and your memo on transforming
normals caught my eye. Another way of looking at the problem is to recall that
a polygonal volume is made up of planes that divide space into two parts. The
columns of the volume matrix are formed from the coefficients of the plane
equations. Transforming a volume matrix requires that you premultiply by the
inverse of the manipulation matrix. The components of a normal are the first
three coefficients of the plane equation. Hence the same idea should apply.
(see PECG Sec. 4-3 on Robert's algorithm pp 211-213).  Surprising what you can
learn from Roberts' algorithm yet most people discount it.

[source: comp.graphics]<BR>
<P>
Here's a new idea I came up with to do caustics, etc. by ray tracing: from your
point on some surface, shoot out some number (say ~100) in "random" directions
(I would probably use a jittered uniform distribution on the sphere).  For each
light source, keep track of all rays that come within some "distance" (some
angle) from the light source.  Then, for each of these rays, try getting closer
to the light source using some sort of Newton-type iteration method... for
example, to do mirrored reflection:

&gt;From point X, shoot out rays in the ~100 "random" directions mentioned above;<BR>
say one of them comes within 0.05 radians of the light source.  Do some sort of<BR>
update procedure on the ray to see if it keeps getting closer to the light<BR>
source; if it does, then you have a solution to the "mirrored reflection"<BR>
problem, and you can shade X properly.  This procedure will work for curved<BR>
mirrors as well as planar ones (unlike the previous idea I mentioned), and will<BR>
also handle caustics well.  It seems obvious to me that there will be bad cases<BR>
for the method, and it is certainly computationally expensive, but it looks<BR>
like a useful method.  Any comments?<BR>

Subject: A call for vectors.....
<P>
Imagine a unit sphere centered at the origin.
<P>
Imagine a vector, the "reference vector", from the origin to any point on the
surface of this sphere.
<P>
I would like to create n vectors which will evenly sample the surface of our
sphere, within some given angle about that "reference vector".
<P>
I need to be able to jitter these vectors in such a way that no two vectors in
a given bunch could be the same.
<P>
This appears to be a job for spherical coordinates, but I can't seem to find a
formula that can treat the surface of a sphere as a "uniform" 2D surface (ie.
no bunching up at the poles).
<P>
I desire these vectors for generating soft shadows from spherical light
sources, and for diffuse illumination guessing.
<P>
I have something now which is empirical and slow - neither of which trait I
find very desirable.
<P>
I will have a need for these vectors often, and seldom will either the
angle or the number of vectors needed be the same across consecutive requests.

Can anyone help me?

&gt; From what I understand, the way to achieve 4 rays per pixel is to sample at<BR>

&gt; 'corner' of each pixel, and average those values.  This is super cheap compared<BR>

<P>
Blech!  Super-sampling, as suggested in the first article, works ok but is very
slow and 4 rays/pixel is not enough for high quality images.  Simply rendering
vres+1 by hres+1 doesn't gain you anything.  All you end up doing is blurring
the image.  This is VERY unpleasant and makes an image look out of focus.
<P>
Aliasing is an artifact of regular under-sampling.  Most people adaptively
super-sample in areas where it is needed (edges, textures, small objects).
Super-sampling in a regular pattern often requires more than 16 rays per
anti-aliased pixel to get acceptable results.  A great improvement comes from
filtering your rays instead of simply averaging them.  Even better is to fire
super-sample rays according to some distribution (eg. Poisson) and then filter
them.
<P>
Check SIGGRAPH proceedings from about 84 - 87 for relevant articles and
pointers to articles.  Changing a ray tracer from simple super-sampling to
adaptive super-sampling can be done in less time than it takes to render an
image, and will save you HUGE amounts of time in the future.  Filtering and
distributing rays takes more work, but the results are good.

<P>
This reuses rays, but since the number of parent rays and number of output
pixels match, this has to be the same as low-pass filtering the output produced
by a raytracer which casts the same number of rays (one per pixel).
<P>
The technique used by Sweeney in 1984 (while here at Waterloo) compares the
four pixel-corner rays and if they are not in close agreement subdivides the
pixel.  The recursion terminates either when the rays from the subpixel's
corners are in close agreement or when some max depth is reached. The subpixel
values are averaged to form the parent pixel intensity (though a more general
convolution could be used in gathering up the subpieces).
<P>
This approach means that the subpixel averaging takes place adaptively in
regions of pixel complexity, as opposed to globally filtering the entire output
raster (which the poster's approach does implicitly).
<P>
The addition can be quite useful. For instance, a scene of flat shaded polygons
renders in virtually the same time as a "one ray per pixel" implementation,
with some slight overhead well spent in properly anti-aliasing the polygon
edges -- no time is wasted on the solid areas.

Subject: anti-aliasing<BR>
[source: comp.graphics]<BR>
<P>
With all these discussions about anti-aliasing for ray tracing, I thought I
would get into the fun also.
<P>
As suggested by many people, adaptive sampling is a good way to start dealing
with anti-aliasing (suggested by Whitted).  For another quick hack on top of
adaptive sampling, you can add jitter (suggested by Cook).  The jitter factor
can be controlled by the recursive depth of the adaptive sampling.  This
combination tends to achieve decent quality.
<P>
Another method which nobody has mentioned is "stratified sampling".  This is
also a rather simple method.  Basically, the pixel is divided into a N-size
grid.  You have a random number generator to sample a ray at (x,y) of the grid.
Then shoot another ray, making sure that the row x and column y are discarded
from further sampling, etc.  Repeat this for N rays.  Note, however, no sharing
of point sampling information is available here.

Rob Cook did this too.  He didn't call it "stratified sampling", though.  The
idea is suggested by the solutions to the "8 queens problem".  You want N
sample points, no 2 of which are in the same column, and no 2 of which are in
the same row.  Then you jitter on top of that....
<P>
p.s.  You better not use the same pattern for each pixel...

[By the way, what kind of adaptive supersampling have people been using?  We've
had fairly good results with the simple "check four corners" algorithm and box
filtering the values generated.  We find that for complex scenes an adaptive
algorithm (which shoots 5 more rays if the subdivision criteria is met) shoots
about 25% more rays overall (a result that Linda Roy also obtained with her
ray-tracer).  What the subdivision criteria are affects this, of course.  We've
been using 0.1 as the maximum ratio of R,G, or B channels of the four pixel
corners.  How have you fared, and what kinds of filtering have you tried?

        During the last week I put myself together and managed to pull out a
second version of my ray tracer (the old one was under the subject: "Another
simple ray tracer available").  Tis one includes most of the options described
in R. Cook's paper on Distributed ray tracing.
<P>
<PRE>
Capabilities of the ray tracer are:
        Gloss (blurred reflection)
        Translucency (blurred refraction)
        Penumbras (area light sources)
        Motion Blur
        Phong illumination model with one light source
        Spheres and squares
        Field of view and arbitrary position of the camera
</PRE>
<P>
The ray tracer has been tested on a SUN 3 and SUN 4.  I have it available under
anonymous ftp on <A HREF="ftp://life.pawl.rpi.edu">life.pawl.rpi.edu</A> (128.113.10.2) in the directory pub/ray
under the name ray.2.0.shar.  There are some older version there if you want to
take a look at them.  If you can't ftp there send me mail and I'll send you a
copy.  I also have a version for the AT&T Pixel Machine (for the few that have
access to one!).
<P>
No speed improvements have been made yet, but I hope I will have Goldsmith's
algorithm running on it soon.  I know that my file format is not standard, but
people can try to write their own routine to read the file.  It's pretty easy.

NAME
     tracer- run a simple ray tracing procedure
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
DESCRIPTION
     Tracer is a program developed originally to study how
     ray tracing works, and was later modified to the present state
     to make it more compatible for animated film production.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
     It is capable of depicting a number of balls (up to 150)
     and a plane that is covered with a tiling of any bitmapped picture.
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
PROGRAM NOTES
     This program generates a file containing a header with x and y sizes,
     followed by the data in 8-bit greyscale, one pixel to a character, in
     scanlines.
     There are two necessary input files: ball data, and a pattern bitmap.
     The tiling bitmap can be digitized data, it must be in the form of
     scan lines no longer than 512 bytes followed by newlines.

An Internet archive for maps of geographic-scale maps has been set up, starting
with data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Cartographic

Elevation Model (DEM) format.
<P>
The archive is on host <A HREF="ftp://panarea.usc.edu">panarea.usc.edu</A> [128.125.3.54], in anonymous FTP
directory pub/map.  Gary Crum (<A HREF="mailto:crum@cse.usc.edu">crum@cse.usc.edu</A>) is maintainer.
<P>
The pub/map directory is writable by anonymous ftp.  Approximately 50M bytes
are available for the map archive as of this writing.
<P>
NOTES:
<P>
* Files ending in the .Z extension have been compressed with the "compress"
program available on comp.sources archives such as j.cc.purdue.edu.  They
should be transferred using the "binary" mode of ftp to UNIX systems.  Send
mail to the maintainer to request format changes (e.g., to uuencoded form split
into small pieces).
<P>
* Some maps, e.g., DEM files from USGS, contain long lines which have been
observed to cause problems transferring with some FTP implementations.  In
particular, a version of the CMU TCP/IP package for VAX/VMS did not support
these long lines.
<P>
* Source code for UNIX tools that manipulate ANSI labeled tapes and VMS tapes
is available as pub/ansitape.tar.Z on the map archive host.
