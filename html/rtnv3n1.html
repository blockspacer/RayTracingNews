        This issue's focus is on timings from various people using a wide
selection of hardware and software.  Much of the delay in getting out this
issue was my desire to finish up my own timing tests of MTV's, Kolb's, and my
own ray tracers on the same machine.  I hope some of you will find this
information of use.
<P>
        Another feature of this issue is a pair of book reviews.  One of the
purposes of the RT News is to provide people with sources of information
relevant to ray tracing.  So, I would like to see more reviews, or even just
brief descriptions of articles and books that you come across.  Keeping up to
date in this field is going to take more time as the years go by, so please do
pass on any good finds you may have.  Also, if you're an author, please feel
free to send a copy of the abstract here for publication.  This service is
already provided to a certain extent by SIGGRAPH for thesis work.  However,
even a duplication of their efforts is worthwhile, since an electronic version
is much easier to search and manipulate.

I'm not professionally involved in ray tracing.  Just personally fascinated by
it.  I have written a couple of ray tracers (who hasn't yet?) and I'm in the
midst of designing a 24 bit frame buffer.  Since I don't do this on a
professional level, I lack some of the resources required to develop real
products.  I maintain a archive site with a lot of graphics related items
(including Ray Tracing News).  If you need to access the archive (anonymous

Currently, I've been spending some time tinkering with the DBWrender ray
tracer making it produce 24 bit/pixel QRT-format images.  I like the QRT
output format, but I like some of the features of DBWrender, such as
antialiasing and fading to a background color.

I've thought about writing my own ray tracer with all the features I want, but
so far I've resisted this evil temptation, and only looked for fancier ones
already done by others who could not resist the temptation.  :^)

In 1987 I implemented a "Three Dimensional Digital Differential Analyser"
(3D-DDA) algorithm, along the lines of Fujimoto and Iwata`s, and used it to
speed up a raytracing system under development at the Computer Science
Department at Curtin University of Technology.

Recently I have got a bit busy developing commercial image processing software
to devote much time to Ray Tracing.

Sometime during 1990 I plan to try to port our Ray Tracing system to a

  I have been interested in ray tracing since 1984, when I wrote a ray tracer
before I knew it was called ray tracing!  Since then I have been reading
journals and tinkering with my ray tracer.
<P>
  The last 3 years were spent marooned off the net, with very poor graphics
output devices; so while some work was done on the ray tracer, I now have a
lot of catching up to do.

using C via TCP/IP protocols on a distributed Apollo network.  Interested in
all aspects of speed-up, parallel architectures, coherency and radiosity -

Ks + T &gt; 1,
</A></FONT>
by Craig Kolb and Eric Haines
</H4>
From: Craig Kolb (<A HREF="mailto:craig@weedeater.math.yale.edu">craig@weedeater.math.yale.edu</A>)
<P>
While adding adaptive tree pruning to rayshade (and discovering a bug), I came
across a question I've had regarding the SPD for a while.
<P>
Some objects have Ks + T &gt; 1.  How can this be?  For example, the spheres in
"mountain" have Ks = .9 and T = .9.  Unless I'm completely out to lunch (which
is possible), ths means that subsequent specularly reflected rays are weighted
by .9, and that transmitted rays are also weighted by .9.  This leads to
"glowing" objects pretty quickly.
<P>
What's wrong in the above description?  Be warned that in "nff2shade.awk", I
set the "specular reflectance" to be min(Ks, 1. - T).
<P>
________
<P>
My reply:
<P>
        Actually, true enough, Ks + T &gt; 1 does occur in the SPD stuff.
I use T in a funny way, since I was trying to make databases that would
display both using hidden surface and ray tracing algorithms.  Hmmm, how
to explain?  Well, imagine you have a glass ball: under the hidden surface
system (without transparency), you'd like the ball to appear opaque, and
so a high Kd is in order.  Now if the thing's transparent, you don't want
Kd to be high.  So what I do is lower Kd and Ks by ( 1 - T ).  An admittedly
weird shading model, which I've now changed a bit (i.e. reflectance and
transmittance are now entirely separate).  So, your solution of turning down
the reflectance is fine.  I should add that I didn't really explain all this
as it's irrelevant for timings (all we care about is what rays get generated,
not the final color), but I agree, it would be nicer to get a good resulting
picture as a check.  I'll change that in the next update of SPD, actually...
thanks for pointing it out!
<P>
________
<P>
Craig's reply:
<P>
Ah, I get it.
<P>
I brought it up because it does make a difference timing-wise if you're using
adaptive tree pruning.  Although you say in the SPD stuff that pruning
shouldn't be used, Mark's raytracer currently has no option to turn it off.  I
was comparing pruned vs. pruned, and noticed that I had many fewer reflected
rays, since my reflectance for the transparent gears was .05 rather than .95.

Quartic Roots,
</A></FONT>
and "Intro to RT" Errata, by Larry Gritz (vax5.cit.cornell.edu!cfwy)
</H4>
    I was trying to find the solution to a quartic equation to solve a
ray-torus intersection test.  I've gotten lots of replies, but generally fall
into one of two categories:  either solve the quartic equation (I forget the
reference now, but I'll send you either a reference or the formula if you want
[It's in the _CRC Standard Math Tables_ book - EAH]), or by some iterative
method.  Everybody says (and I have confirmed this experimentally) that
solving the equation is very numerically unstable.  I have chosen to use the
Laguerre method from Press, et. al. _Numerical Recipes in C_, which is slow,
but seems to work, and finds all roots without needing to specify brackets for
the roots.  (An advantage since although I can bracket all possible real roots
with the bounding box test that I already do, I'm not really sure how many
roots lie within the brackets.)
<P>
    What actually turns out to be a bigger problem is that I got the quartic
coefficients from the SIGGRAPH '88 Ray Tracing Course Notes (on page 3-14 of
Pat Hanrahan's section).
<P>
[Larry and I thrashed this out over a number of passes (boy, I wish I had access
to Mathematica or somesuch), and came out with the following corrected
equation set for those on page 93 of _An Introduction to Ray Tracing_:
<P>
<PRE>
        a4 & a3 - Pat's are OK.
        a2 = 2(x1^2+y1^2+z1^2)((x0^2+y0^2+z0^2)-(a^2+b^2))
              + 4 * (x0x1+y0y1+z0z1)^2 + 4a^2z1^2
        a1 = 4 * (x0x1+y0y1+z0z1)((x0^2+y0^2+z0^2)-(a^2+b^2))
                + 8a^2 * z0 * z1
        a0 = ((x0^2+y0^2+z0^2)-(a^2+b^2))^2 - 4a^2(b^2-z^2)

Are you sure about this?  If it's the same closed-form solution that you find
in the CRC books, etc., doesn't it use trig functions and cube roots?   Seems
to me there was a paper by Kajiya in the early '80s on numerical ray tracing,
and there have been several in the last few years.  My advice would be to go
look at SIGGRAPH proceedings from 1981 on.  Certainly, a closed form solution
like the one suggested wouldn't take advantage of any coherence in the problem,
unless you wrote all the trig stuff yourself.

Question: Kay and Kajiya Slabs for Arbitrary Quadrics?
</A></FONT>
 by Thomas C. Palmer (<A HREF="mailto:palmer@mcnc.org">palmer@mcnc.org</A>)
</H4>
Here's a question regarding slabs for arbitrary quadrics.  Kay & Kajiya '86
discusses computing slabs for polygons and implicit surfaces.  The method for
implicit surfaces using Lagrange multipliers and gives an example using
spheres.  This is easy and works quite nicely for canonical (i.e. centered
and axis aligned) quadrics.  K&K handle object rotations and translations
during the slab computation.  What about quadrics that have been transformed
by some arbitrary matrix prior to input and look like this:
<P>
ax^2 + 2bxy + 2cxz + 2dxw + ey^2 + 2fyz + 2gyw + hz^2 + 2izw + jw^2 = 0 ?
<P>
The xy, xz, and yz terms prevent a simple solution via Lagrange multipliers.
Has anyone done this?  How do you handle quadric bounding planes?  Note that
K&K cheated for the tree branchs in the tree models.  Each cylinder has
endpoint capping spheres so the cylinder's extent is just the combined extent
of the two spheres.
<P>
Thanks for your help -

Ambient Term,

</H4>
I just read your Tracing tricks in the latest Ray Tracing News. Thanks for
passing that on to us, this was very interesting.
<P>
One trick you mentioned was to put a light source at the eye position in
order to eliminate the ambient term. This is a simple trick I did not know.
However, you noted that highlights appears as artifacts.
<P>
Since you know that this light does not need any shadow rays, you could use
only the diffuse intensity created by this light to approximate the ambient
term, hence creating no undesirable highlights.
<P>
I know, this is very easy and everyone probably knows that. But just in
case you would not have thought about it, I wanted to indicate it to you. I
just hope I am not the 10,000th to tell you :^)
<P>
________
<P>
My reply:
<P>
        I'm glad to hear that you enjoyed the "Tracing Tricks" article -
sometimes I worry that I'm just publishing ideas that everyone already knows.
I've tried having the ambient light have no highlight, and it's sort of
interesting, but the lack of highlight can look a little strange for those
objects where there really would be a highlight (it sort of makes them look
less shiny, though it also depends upon the other lights in the scene).
Nonetheless, turning it off is definitely worth exploring.  You're the first
person to comment on this, actually.  Thanks for taking the time to write, and
do keep in touch.

This two-volume series of books is one man's effort to provide a guide to the
study of hierarchical data structures.  The topic has extensive influence on
many fields, particularly computer graphics, image processing, and
computational geometry.  Hanan Samet is a well-established expert in the
field, with literally dozens of publications.  As a computer graphics
researcher, I eagerly anticipated the books' publication.  A close examination
of both volumes leads to one conclusion:  the books are extremely worthwhile.

The integration of diverse material is remarkable.  Comprehensive research
results throughout the spectrum of science are drawn together seamlessly.
Samet has really done a thorough job of pulling together literature from a
vast collection of conferences and journals, both major and minor.
<P>
The level of explanation is good.  Samet has obviously read all of his
references thoroughly.  The descriptions of algorithms reflect an
understanding of what is really going on.  Even algorithms mentioned briefly
are given a good essential description.
<P>
Numerous topics are covered.  Algorithms for such problems as
proximity-searching, efficient storage of image and volume data, constructive
solid geometry, data structure conversion, hidden surface removal, and
ray-tracing fill the books.  Pseudo-ALGOL code examples present detailed
explanations of how to build and traverse many of the data structures.
Ray-tracing enthusiasts in particular will enjoy a detailed description of how
to trace a path through an octree.
<P>
There are, however, a few problems with the presentation.  Despite the
ambitious titles of the volumes, there is nowhere near as much theory or
practical advice as one might expect.  The emphasis is instead on explaining
literally everything at an understandable level.  While this makes the books a
wonderful introduction to all sorts of stuff, the reader still needs guidance
in choosing what techniques to actually use.
<P>
The title of the first volume, "The Design and Analysis of Spatial Data
Structures", obviously invokes comparison with the classic text "The Design
and Analysis of Computer Algorithms", by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman.  However,
Samet's approach differs greatly from that of Aho et al.  While the data
structures are described and discussed in detail, the analysis is not very
formal.  Theorems and proofs, as well as detailed algorithm analysis, are not
much in evidence.  A more appropriate title might simply be "An Introduction
to Spatial Data Structures".
<P>
The second book, "Applications of Spatial Data Structures", covers basically
every research result in hierarchical algorithms, major or minor.  It is
exceptionally good at explaining techniques succinctly.  The depth is not
sufficient enough to implement the techniques without referring to the
original papers, however.  Additionally, the reader is given no good feel for
which results should actually be used.  If a technique is commonly used in
industry or never used because of impracticality, Samet never says so.  The
reader who expects a "cookbook" solution to his problem will be disappointed.
<P>
The books are primarily of use for two purposes.  First, they provide a good
introduction to those aspects of computational geometry and image processing
which are most likely to be of interest to a person working in graphics.
Second, they provide a very complete guidebook to the literature.  I would
suggest that researchers and practitioners have these volumes on their
reference shelves.  Due to the sheer volume of material presented, I would not
recommend them for use as course textbooks.

Comparison of Kolb,
</A></FONT>
Haines, and MTV Ray Tracers, Part I, by Eric Haines
</H4>
        I decided to compare the MTV ray tracer, the Kolb "rayshade" software,
and my own modified "SBRR" ray tracing package to see the efficiency of each.
My goal was to see what sort of performance was obtained by each ray tracer
and note the strengths and weaknesses of each.  This first section of the
report marks the state of current results, consisting of timings from the
"gprof" command for each package, using the Standard Procedural Database (SPD)
package.  All three packages were run on an HP 350 workstation with a floating
point accelerator board.  The compiler options were "-g -G +ffpa" (debug,
profile, with special floating-point only compile), using HP-UX 6.5.
<P>
        The three ray tracers were selected from all the existing packages by
having the following properties:  (1) Each could handle all the primitives in
the SPD package, and (2) each had some automatic efficiency scheme.  Other
packages do not support all the primitives (e.g. DBW does not have cylinders,
cones, or n-sided polygons), or do not have automatic efficiency generation
(e.g.  QRT lets you explicitly create bounding boxes, but has no way for this
to happen automatically).
<P>
        The MTV ray tracer was created by Mark VandeWettering, and uses the
Kay/Kajiya hierarchy approach (i.e. sorting objects along X/Y/Z and splitting
each group, recursively).  To make it conform to the requirements of the SPD
tests, "minweight" was set to 0.0 in order to disable tree pruning a la Hall's
method.
<P>
        Craig Kolb's "rayshade" ray tracer uses a 22x22x22 grid on all scenes.
Because of the use of grids (i.e.  3DDDA), it was found to be sensitive to the
background polygons used in the SPD package.  In four of the SPD scenes
(balls, gears, rings, and tree) there is a "ground" polygon.  The "rayshade"
software allows some user intervention in how the database is structured.  It
was found that faster timings (sometimes strikingly quicker) could be obtained
by leaving this background polygon out of the grid structure.  Changing the
database in this manner is forbidden by the SPD tests, but both sets of
results are presented because of the difference in timings.
<P>
        The SBRR package is not public domain, but rather is part of the
graphics software in all HP workstations using the Turbo-SRX graphics
accelerator.  It uses the Goldsmith and Salmon automatic bounding volume
hierarchy method.  It should also be noted that this package is full featured,
which has a corresponding slowdown effect when intersection computations are
performed.  For example, polygons can be single or double sided, with
different materials, colors per vertex, normals per vertex, and other
combinations available.  Since the package has a "hardware assist" by using
the graphics engine as an item buffer (see Weghorst and Hooper), timings are
given both with and without this assist.  The times without are the fairer of
the two for comparison.
<P>
Without further ado, here are the timings:

</PRE>
<P>
Some interesting phenomena are revealed by the statistics.  The "tetra"
database is pretty much the same absolute speed for everyone.  However, given
the performance for other scenes, it is noteworthy that MTV performs
relatively faster on this than others.  I've noticed this, too, when trying
Kay/Kajiya myself - this scheme just soars on tetra, though I am not sure why.
Perhaps it is the smallness and regularity of the objects, which would go well
with Kay/Kajiya's assumption that using the centroid of these is reasonable.
For other databases one can imagine better hierarchies that those constructed
by Kay/Kajiya.  For example, with mount, the four spheres above the fractal
mountain should be in their own cluster just off the top of the hierarchy
tree.
<P>
The "tetra" scene is a strange test in that most (around 81%) of the scene
is background, so what we tend to test here is affected more by how fast one can
traverse a scene, set up rays, shade, and store values in a file.  It will take
further analysis to see where the time is spent.
<P>
The Kolb ray tracer is interesting in how much its efficiency scheme is
affected by the geometry of the scene.  The "teapot in a football stadium"
effect I've written about previously hits grid efficiency schemes with a
vengeance.  For example, moving the ground polygon from the grid subdivision
to outside of it makes rayshade perform 4.6 times faster for balls, and 7.7
times faster for tree!  The point is that grids perform best when the scene is
relatively "compact".  The large ground polygons in these scenes cause the
entire grid to get larger in two directions, and so make many more objects
fall inside but a few grid squares, thereby ruining much of the efficiency of
the grid.
<P>
Comparing Kolb to MTV, we see that overall Kolb is faster.  Kolb does worse on
balls and tree using the unmodified database, but otherwise outperforms MTV,
being about twice as fast.  When the ground polygon is taken out of the grid
subdivision, Kolb is more than 3 times faster for all cases except tetra.
<P>
Comparing SBRR and MTV shows SBRR to be faster for most cases, with MTV being
slightly faster for tetra.  Overall SBRR is almost twice as fast with its
basic performance, and about 2.75 times faster when the item buffer is used.
<P>
Comparing SBRR and Kolb is a bit tricky, since there are two tests of each.
Taking the basic tests in each, Kolb and SBRR are comparable: Kolb outperforms
SBRR in four cases, and SBRR outperforms Kolb in two (and for one of those,
tree, it is almost 6 times faster).  SBRR has some things to learn from Kolb
(which is why I'm doing all this, anyway), as Kolb's modified database results
point towards the fact that faster performance is possible.
<P>
So, on the basis of pure raw timings, Kolb and SBRR without modifications or
accelerators are of comparable speed.  With user intervention into the
database structure, Kolb can become noticeably faster.  It should also be
noted that Kolb uses a default of 22x22x22 grid cells, which is under user
control and so could be tuned to further improve performance.
<P>
Actually, this is an interesting open question:  what heuristics can be used
to determine a reasonable grid size for a scene?  Also, is there a reasonable
way to determine if such performance destroyers such as ground polygons are
present automatically, and so remove them from the grid subdivision itself?
David Jevans' and Brian Wyvill's work on nested grid subdivisions ("Adaptive
Voxel Subdivision for Ray Tracing", Proceedings of Graphics Interface '89, p.
164-172) might lead to a less variable performance and to greater overall
speed.  Craig and I have discussed this, but unfortunately he has no time to
try this out - perhaps someone out there can experiment and compare
results.
<P>
As mentioned, this is research in progress.  My next step will be to analyze
the statistics generated by each program and see where time is spent.

Raytracer Performance of MTV,
</A></FONT>
by Steve Lamont
</H4>
&gt;   Could you pass on your timings on ray tracer performance on various<BR>
&gt; machines and any thoughts or experiences you want to share about the subject?<BR>
<P>
The parallelization was done in a brute force manner, forking processes and
dividing the work by the number of processes.  The parent process remains
behind and reads the scanlines in a round robin fashion from pipes.  There is
no communication from the parent to the child processes once the forking has
been done; the ray tracing routines simply march down the scan lines.  This
approach works well on a homogeneous architecture where all processes run at
approximately the same speed and no process "dries up" or runs out of work to
do.
<P>
This works well for single frames.  However, my approach for a large animation
is to simply parcel out work on a frame per processor basis.

I've built the MTV raytracer on the Cray, the IRIS, and the Ardent Titan...

Wall clock times improved by a factor of 2.5 to 3, which squares pretty well
with Amdahl's law as extended for small parallel architectures.
<P>
These are *preliminary* results with respect to the Titan -- we've only had it
for a couple of weeks.  On none of the machines did MTV vectorize in any way
to speak of.  In fact, turning off vectorization improves performance for
several "short vector" loops; e.g., loops of vector length 3.

Timings were done on a fairly heavily loaded Cray and an empty IRIS and Titan.

The Cray is a Y-MP with four processors (upgradable to 8, hence the 8-4) and

experience I have with ray-tracing timing on our machines is with a simple,
interactive ( :-&gt; ) ray-tracer demo called 'flyray'.  I modified it to be
fully parallelized; it uses one CPU to display a real-time display of the
scene being ray-traced (complete with rays shooting into and bouncing around
the scene), and the other N-1 CPUs to compute ray-object intersections (these
results are shown in a separate window).  As for timing... runs REAL fast on
an 8 CPU system.

DESCRIPTION
-----------
</PRE>
The BRL-CAD benchmark is a part of the US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory's
BRL-CAD package.  The core of the BRL-CAD benchmark is a ray-tracing program
which consists of about 150,000 lines of C code.  Computations are performed
in double precision floating point.
<P>
Five separate data bases are input to the ray tracing program, resulting in
six performance ratings (one for each, plus a total which is the mean of the
other five) .  When rendered, each data base will produce a 512x512x24 bit
color shaded image.  The images are of increasing complexity, and are
identified as 'Moss', 'World', 'Star', 'Bldg' and 'M35'.
<P>
<PRE>
RESULTS
-------
</PRE>
The result of this benchmark is reported as rays traced per second, and
referred to as Ray Tracing Figure of Merit (RTFM).  Higher numbers indicate
better performance.
<P>
The code was parallelized by inserting user directives to create multiple
processes to trace rays.

ANALYSIS
--------
</PRE>
The BRL-CAD benchmark exhibits excellent speedup as processors are added.
This is due to the coarse granularity inherent in the ray tracing problem
being solved.  Each ray is processed independently, with no data dependencies
among the rays.  This means that multiple processors can each work on separate
rays simultaneously, with minimal need for synchronization among processors.
<P>
While the code is highly parallelizable, it is not efficiently vectorizable
because of short vector lengths.  The combination of these two
characteristics explain the phenomenal performance of Silicon Graphics
machines relative to vector machines like Cray and Alliant.
<P>
The characteristics of this benchmark that lead to high performance by the
Silicon Graphics machines are common to all ray tracing applications.
<P>
________
<P>
Here is another note from Gavin:
<P>
My only experience with the BRL ray-tracer came when I was at Princeton
University - I installed it on Silicon Graphics machines there for the
Graphics Lab.  That was two years ago; as far as I could tell, it didn't use
octrees or any other space-partitioning algorithm.  I used a ray-tracer
written at Princeton (the precursor of what is now Craig Kolb's rayshade
program; Craig and I had the same thesis advisor) which did do octrees; it was
infinitely faster than the BRL beast.

<P>
The code running on the iPSC/2 emulates a virtual shared memory over the local
PEs.  The database is not duplicated but all the local memories are used.  The
remaining memory after loading code and data is used as a cache to speed up
low global accesses.
<P>
_____
<P>
        In order to benchmark our parallel raytracer running on an iPSC/2,
which use Eric Haines' NFF file format as input, we would like to know
if other people have a parallel raytracer using these databases
in order to make some comparisons.
<P>
        One of our goals is to render the largest possible
database.  For the moment, we have rendered the 'tetra10'
database:
        - the database contains more than 1 million polygons (1048576
          polygons)
        - the size of the database with its 'object access structure' (a
          grid) is 140 MO.
        - the synthesis time is 526 seconds on the iPSC/2 with 64 nodes
          and 4 MO node memory.
        - however, on account of using NFF text file format, reading the
          input is  very slow (more than 3 hours for 'tetra10') when using
          YACC and LEX. Furthermore, our iPSC/2 configuration does not have
          I/O  node  system.
<P>

&gt; Does anyone know of a system with "smart" pixels? <BR>
<P>
Once upon a time I wrote a ray tracer in which the pixels used heuristics to
determine their sampling rate.  Since the reason for doing it was to speed
things up, the heuristic had to be simpler than casting a ray( s, if
sub-sampling).  I used difference in previous pixels values, with a little
randomness tossed in.  So pixels changing quickly were sampled every frames,
while pixels that were hardly ever changing were sampled only once every 10
frames.  The results:  much faster, but with a graininess on the edges of
moving objects.  I needed to make the pixels more aware of what was happening
with its neighbors.  Never got around to doing that.
<P>
Another problem is big pictures have lots of pixels ... 512x512 = 0.25 million.
To be smart you must have a memory.
<P>
To save memory, I combined the above with an Area-of-Interest/Variable Acuity
(AOIVA) Ray Tracer.

True Integration of Linear/Area Lights,

<P>
Has anyone seen any work done on evaluating the diffuse and specular
illumination produced by linear and/or area lights?  I have checked all the
standard sources and all information I find gets to the point where the
integration is set up and then a little hand waving is performed accompanied
by the magical words "numerically integrated".  This works but is too slow
for my purposes.  Does anyone know of any work done in different directions
(ie faster evaluation) ?
<P>
________
<P>
Thanks to all who replied to my query about linear and area lights.
<P>
In the area of linear lights, two papers on analytical solutions were found.
The first, by John Amanatides and Pierre Poulin has been submitted to
Eurographics '90 and I'll hopefully get a look at that soon.
<P>
The second, "Shading Models for Point and Linear Sources", ACM TOGS, 4(2),
April 1985, pp. 124-146.  by T. Nishita, I. Okamura, E. Nakamae, proposes
an analytic solution to the diffuse component, but only under certain
circumstances.
<P>
The latter unfortunately reduces to numerical integration in the majority of
cases where spline surfaces are involved, although a method of optimization is
given that reduces computation time for the numerical integration.  This
method would seem to be suited to lighting parallel and perpendicular to the
illuminated surfaces.
<P>
There was also a paper entitled "A Comprehensive Light-Source Description for
Computer Graphics", IEEE CG&A, July 1984, by Channing P. Verbeck and Donald
P. Greenberg that approximates both linear and area light sources as a series
of point sources.  This is a compromise to numerical integration, but is still
computationally expensive.
<P>
In summary, the analytical solution to linear sources exists and is
calculable, at least for the diffuse component.  The specular component
exists, but direct calculation is almost expensive as numerical integration.
<P>
As far as area light sources are concerned... no analytical solutions were
found.  In fact, from the work examined I was left with the impression that
even if the solution existed it would not be very useful from a light
illumination point of view (ie non-radiosity).  (Comments?)
