Introduction

</H4>
First off, the Ray Tracing Roundtable will meet yet again at SIGGRAPH:
<P>
<PRE>
        Thursday, 5:15 pm (the room opens at 5) to 6:45
        Westin Bonaventure (the HQ hotel), in the San Fernando room
</PRE>
<P>
The timing and place are such that you can catch it while moseying from the
convention center (where things wrap up around 5 pm) to the papers/panels
reception at 7 pm (about 2 blocks walk from the Westin).
<P>
The Roundtable is where anyone interested in ray tracing to gather and connect
names with faces.  There are usually around 50 people who show up, we go
around the room and say names and what we're up to nowadays, then break up and
schmooze.  The gathering started as a way for researchers to talk about ideas.
It has evolved into a general gathering for anyone interested in 3D rendering
to meet like minded souls.

OK, so I've been trying to ignore the net and whatnot and get some Real Work
(tm) done, but people keep coming out with some amazing things.  Not too many
new free ray tracers of note, but Chris Cason's POV ray tracing CD is finally
out.  The Graphics Gems V code is available online, beating the book's
publication by a few months.  There's now a
<A HREF="#mesa">
free OpenGL implementation</A>
for
Unix boxes and MS Windows, and the
<A HREF="#art6">
Dore'
</A>
object oriented library has been made
available for free [see <A HREF="rtnews2a.html#art2">RTNews2</A>].
SGI provides a free parser for reading and
traversing
<A HREF="#vrml">
VRML
</A>
(and there are three or more free/beta viewers out there right
now).  Glassner's magnum opus (so far), _Digital Image Synthesis_, is finally
out [briefly reviewed back in <A HREF="rtnv7n3.html#art3">RTNv7n3</A>].
<P>
In other news, ACM Transactions on Graphics has a new Editor in Chief, Andrew
Glassner.  He and I have been working on WWW pages for ACM TOG, and the basics
are finally ready:  check out <A HREF="http://www.acm.org/pubs/tog/">http://www.acm.org/pubs/tog/</A> .  I consider the
most significant page the Reviewing Guidelines, as here Andrew gives a sense
of where he wants to see TOG go, and it's significantly different than the
current public perception; please read it if you do research (and even if you
don't).  There are other pages of interest, such as the Editors page, where
you can put names to faces for a number of graphics researchers; there are
also links to what they are researching.  I spent a fair amount of time on the
Resources links, which point to software and other data of particular interest
to researchers.  I tried to limit my choices to significant tools and sites
and pointers to other links of interest.  I have also tried to avoid
duplication of previous efforts, such as material already in computer graphics
related FAQs.  There is definitely a 3D and ray tracing bias to some of these
pages; I look to you all to point out other resources you consider significant
and worth adding.
<P>
I am also helping cobble up some WWW pages for my company.  You might want to
check out <A HREF="http://www.eye.com/">http://www.eye.com/</A> sometime; I plan on having my own homepage
someday, with pointers to where to access the most recent version of materials
I have on the net (papers, SPD package, RT News archives, etc) - in the
meantime check out "Freebies".  Buy a few thousand dollars worth of products
when you visit, please.

Contest: Name that Area Ratio
</A></FONT>
</H4>
So, you know how to find if a circle and hyperbola intersect, you know how to
compute the area of a polygon, and you know how to find the convex hull of a
set of points.  Now's your chance to win a free CD ROM for learning all that
stuff.
<P>
Take a crack at this problem:  given the set of all arbitrary triangles (i.e.
3 random dots, anywhere on a 2D plane) and a 2D bounding box around each, what
is the average ratio of the area covered by the triangle vs.  the box?  The
answer is actually a useful thing to know, if you're trying to design an
optimal point-in-polygon test and you know the point is inside the bounding
box.  I'll be interested in your answer and how you got to it.  The prize for
the best (decided in some arbitrary fashion) correct answer:  a copy of Chris
Cason's POV ray tracing CD ROM (see the Roundup) or a copy of one of Syndesis'
CD ROMs (kindly donated by John Foust) (see
<A HREF="rtnv6n2.html#art8">RTNv6n2</A>,
<A HREF="rtnv6n3.html#art14">RTNv6n3</A>,
and <A HREF="rtnv8n1.html#art10">RTNv8n1</A>).
<P>
I'd also be interested in the answer to the same question for four arbitrary
points on a plane and the average area of the polygon vs. the box area.  For
maximal bonus points (redeemable for plastic spiders at video arcades around
the country) what's this ratio for four arbitrary points which form a polygon
which doesn't overlap (i.e.  doesn't make an hourglass shape)?  Finally, what
about the set of all convex four pointed polygons?  I haven't a clue what the
answers are to these four-point questions, but would be interested to know
them.  Answers backed by theory are best, but having your PC churn out the
answer by doing a bazillion iterations and averaging the results is OK, too
(aka Monte Carlo).

3D Graphics Programming in Windows, by Philip Taylor Jr., Addison-Wesley,
1994, comes with disk, isbn: 0-201-60882-0, 877 pages, $49.95 US
<P>
An interesting book:  if you're interested in writing 3D related programs for
MS Windows, this is a good place to start.  He describes how to make a 3D
modeler, a vector rendering library, a ray tracer, and many other design
elements.  The bias is towards pure Windows code (I prefer Visual C++), but
this is a minor part of the presentation; the elements presented are generally
applicable to any Windows environment program and, to a lesser extent,
interactive graphics programming in general.  Contact Phil Taylor

take advantage of any native graphics accelerators, so you won't want to use
it on your Reality Engine, but for the rest of us it's a cheap alternative.

Geomview, Interactive View For 3-D Geometric Objects
<P>
The Geometry Center announces the availability of release 1.5 of Geomview.
Geomview is an interactive viewer for 3-D geometric objects.  It allows users
to view and manipulate these objects via the mouse, the keyboard, and through
an interpreted command language.  This release includes versions for SGI
(using GL graphics), NeXTStep (requires NeXTStep version 3.0 or higher), and
generic Xlib graphics.  Precompiled binaries are available for SGI, NeXT
(m68k/intel/hppa), Sun4, HP, Linux, IBM RS/6000 and DEC Alpha platforms.  The
source code is also available.  These distributions are all in
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.geom.umn.edu/pub/software/geomview">ftp://ftp.geom.umn.edu/pub/software/geomview</A> For more details, and for a list
of changes since previous releases of Geomview, see the README file in that
same directory.
<P>
Geomview is part of an effort at the Geometry Center to provide interactive 3D
graphics which is well-suited for mathematics visualization.  In addition,
Geomview is extensible and can serve as a general-purpose tool.  Its
functionality can be extended in an almost unlimited fashion by external
modules or programs.

On displacement mapping and ray tracing:
<P>
Larry Gritz stated, "On the other hand, you can't get true displacements with
BMRT (or any ray tracer)".  I'm not sure I completely agree here.  Polyray
does displacements of surfaces by splitting them into triangles and then
moving vertices.  These triangles can be rendered with raytracing, zbuffer
rendering, or ASCII output (of triangle vertices).
<P>
Is this "true" displacement?  Perhaps not, but if you instruct Polyray to dice
the prims up fine enough, you really can't see the difference.  The cost is
the storage and preprocessing of a big bag of triangles.  Even bucket oriented
renderer like Photorealistic RenderMan has to dice its prims into polygons,
and will have occasions where many are active at once, it just doesn't have to
have them for the entire world (to account for off-screen reflections, etc.)
<P>
The other comment I have is on your discussion on scanline rendering, "Also,
as far as CSG - forget it trying to get the polygonal version of a CSG
model...".  I agree with what I think you were saying, however there is a
solution that doesn't require a complete b-rep description of your CSG model.
<P>
The approach I took in Polyray to rendering CSG during scanline rendering is
to do the CSG in image space.  As each pixel is generated, you use the
interpolated world (or object) coordinates as a parameter to the normal CSG
inside/outside routines.  The result is pretty good, and can usually be made
as good as you want by subdividing prims more finely.  The two major
drawbacks:  you are doing CSG evaluations on parts of a prim that will never
appear on the screen, and you don't have a nice polygonal model that can be
exported to something else.
<P>

Eric Haines replied:
<P>
Interesting:  so what happens exactly when I, say, subtract a sphere from the
corner of a cube?  I render the cube and indeed the points in the sphere
disappear.  I then render, what, the inside of the sphere and test its points
for inclusion within the cube, right?  Hmmm, so you basically have to make
sure you do the CSG inside/outside test but making sure you don't use the
object itself being rendered to affect the inside/outside determination,
right?  Good one, I like it!  Probably not the fastest thing on two wheels,
but it beats some of the various multi-buffer schemes I've seen for both
memory and simplicity.  In (what I call) multi-buffer, you render all the CSG
objects in a model and then sort out the details at each pixel by checking the
set of valid spans for that pixel and finding the closest point - cuts down on
in/out tests (there are none), but a nasty thing to program and manage memory.
<P>
____
<P>
Alexander replies:
<P>
You just render the sphere.  Since I'm not doing backface culling, I only need
one routine to turn the sphere into polys.  The only time I look at the normal
is for shading.
<P>
I know perfectly well that culling speeds things up, however I'd rather know
about both sides of an object.  That way if you chop a hole in a primitive
(clipping rather than CSG difference) you see the back wall rather than having
a total hole.
<P>
&gt;&gt; but making sure you don't use the object itself being rendered to<BR>
&gt;&gt; affect the inside/outside<BR>
<P>
Turns out that's pretty easy.  Each object has a pointer to the CSG tree it is
sitting in.  As you render an object you do inside/outside by walking up the
tree.  Since you know which branch you came from, you can avoid doing
comparisons against yourself.
<P>
&gt;&gt; Probably not the fastest thing on two wheels,<BR>
<P>
Nope, but then I was more concerned with making it work than making it go as
fast as possible.  I've got a renderer that can produce consistent images
using either raytracing or scanline rendering for a huge variety of
primitives.  I'll leave the superfast polygon rendering to the commercial
folks.  [I don't even have tables for doing sin/cos, always found more
interesting things to work on.]

[Nico Tenoutasse wrote asking what sort of things are worth exploring in the
field of ray tracing.  Part of my reply follows.  Nothing brilliant here, but
I do feel strongly that more goofing off could pay back with interesting
imagery, optical illusions, etc.]
<P>
In the rendering/animation front, there's a lot to explore with non-real
rendering:  serious stuff like "make the image look like it was hand-drawn and
shaded, automatically" and silly stuff like "what does it look like if I put a
totally wacky shading model in place?"  Or what can be done when you ray trace
and barely hit an object - make it partially transparent there, or change its
color, or maybe you make it black there and everything then looks like a
cartoon, or...?  Who knows?  We need more people to goof off with shading
models and intersection methods and so on - mostly a waste of time, but there
are probably some interesting methods, so far undiscovered, that can be done
by varying our assumptions.

<P>
<I>Abstract</I><BR>
Today's radiosity methods are able to produce nearly perfect light
distributions for interior rooms. Unrealistic appearance now mainly is due
to missing texturing of the walls. One important feature of public room
walls are footprints in the lower areas. This paper presents a set of
simple functions to easily generate a class of footprint textures for such
applications. Different randomization techniques ensure the realistic
appearance of the results. This technique is of increasing importance for
the visualization of architectural objects in the future.
Keywords

<P>
<I>Introduction</I><BR>
Today's radiosity methods are able to produce nearly perfect light
distributions of interior rooms. Unrealistic appearance now mainly is due
to missing texturing of the walls. One important feature of public room
walls are footprints in the lower areas.
<P>
<I>The Footprint Function</I><BR>
The basic footprint function is a combination of trivial, i.e. easy to
implement, parametric functions. The footprint is divided into a ball and a
heel which can have independent sole textures. The sizes are chosen such
that a simulation of shoe sizes 35 to 42 for women profiles and 39 to 46
for men profiles is performed.
<P>
<I>Randomization Techniques</I><BR>
Distribution techniques will be presented that ensure that the lower part
of the wall contains significantly more footprints than the higher parts.
Especially, no footprints must occur above a certain threshold height, due
to physiological limitations of the human being. Additionally, random
functions will take care that most footprints remain incomplete and vary in
color and shape.
<P>
<I>Results</I><BR>
Preliminary investigations are encouraging. As we have not implemented the
new method yet, there are no concrete results, yet. The final paper might
include images.

<I>Efficient Radiosity for Daylight Simulation in Closed Environments</I><BR>
<P>
<I>Introduction</I><BR>
Radiosity is a useful tool for architects and lighting engineers to
simulate illumination in the interior of buildings. Unfortunately, the
computation time for radiosity is very high. However, radiosity algorithms
can take advantage of special scene properties of specific classes of
environments. Exploiting the additional information about the scene
structure of a particular class can decrease the computation time
significantly. The aim of this paper is to speed up the radiosity
computation for the class of closed environments without artificial light
sources.
<P>
<I>Two Restrictions on the Scene Structure</I><BR>
The first restriction on the scene is that it is closed. The reason for
this restriction is the fact that radiosity is based upon the energy
conservation principle, that means that at any time the amount of emitted
energy equals the amount of absorbed energy plus the amount of energy
leaving the scene. In closed scenes no energy leaves the scene, thus
simplifying the radiosity computation. However, this restriction does not
impose problems, because radiosity is mostly used for interior scenes.
The second restriction is that only daylight can be considered. Radiosity
algorithms solve a set of equations, where the radiosities of patches are
the unknowns and the emissions are the constant terms. In conventional
radiosity all patches are allowed to emit light, i.e. to be an artificial
light source. If we assume that no patch has emission, we only have to
consider daylight. This allows the use of very efficient solution methods
known in numerical mathematics for the set of equations. The second
restriction does not limit the range of applications too much as well,
because in most cases architects are interested in visualizing their design
with daylight conditions.
<P>
<I>Mathematical Foundation of the New Method</I><BR>
Details will be described in the final paper.<BR>
<P>
<I>Benefits</I><BR>
The new method reduces the computation time of both the radiosity
evaluation and of image generation. Images can be generated at interactive
rates even for very complex scenes, making the method suitable for
walk-throughs and VR-applications. Since numerical techniques are mainly
replaced by analytical formulas, no aliasing effects appear.
<P>
<I>Conclusion and Future Work</I><BR>
The development of radiosity algorithms for special classes of scenes is a
promising field of future research. Such algorithms are significantly
faster and possibly more accurate than non-specialized algorithms.<BR>

<P>
These first two productions have at least a little bit the structure of a
scientific paper abstract. What we also wanted to try was, if VIDEA would
accept its own text as abstract. So we copied the complete introduction
from the "Call for Papers" and gave this abstract the title of the
conference. Minor changes were only made like changing the word
"conference" to "paper". The result is given in abstract 3.
<P>

<P>
Last but not least we decided to produce an abstract without any content,
just complete nonsense. So we took a dictionary of information processing
words and selected randomly some 40 phrases from there and joined them
together to a fantastically technical sounding text. The given reference
is, of course, the utilized dictionary! We had much fun with abstract 4.

All abstracts were sent to the conference in November 1994 and on January
14th, 1995 we received the results. All four abstract have been "reviewed
and provisionally accepted"!

[More follows; also, in case you've seen only this posting (which got passed
around far and wide--I received about 7 copies from different people), there
is a response from the conference organizers and a reply by W. Purgathofer et

Still More on Optical Ray Tracing,
</A></FONT>
by Dan Reiley (<A HREF="mailto:primo@moontarz.nuance.com">primo@moontarz.nuance.com</A>)
</H4>
&gt;I am looking for a shareware program to do some ray tracing of a<BR>
&gt;polychromatic laser beam passing through an optical system consisting of a<BR>
&gt;few lenses of different geometries.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<BR>
<P>
Based on the shareware and low-budget raytracing software I have seen, you are
better off using the y-nu raytracing chart.
<P>
Both the programs and the y-nu take a few hours to learn.  Both have output
that is at least a little bit cryptic the first time it is seen.  Howver, if
you use the y-nu you will learn something universal; with the program you will
learn something particular to that program.  The y-nu raytracing chart can be
set up easily in a spreadsheet like Excel.  It is essentially an adaptation of
the matrix method for paraxial raytracing, with simple equations for what
happens to a ray's height between optical surfaces and what happens to its
slope at optical surfaces.  By tracing two rays (usually the chief ray and the
marginal ray) the system can be well- characterized.
<P>
I learned the y-nu raytracing chart from Modern Optical Engineering by Donald
O'Shea, which has a clear and self-contained chapter on it.

Raytracing and 3D Studio,
</A></FONT>
by Michael Adams (<A HREF="mailto:msadams@netcom.com">msadams@netcom.com</A>) and Brian Hoffman (<A HREF="mailto:bhoffman@mail.valverde.edu">bhoffman@mail.valverde.edu</A>)
</H4>
3D Studio needs a raytracer.
<P>
Now I have heard the arguments that raytracers are too slow, and I agree they
are for most animations.  For stills, however, they can make good sense.  You
simply cannot get the realistic reflections that a raytracer produces with 3D
Studio's reflection mapping.  That is not to say that 3D Studio's rendering
engine is bad.  In fact, it is excellent.
<P>
I ran some tests over the weekend with POVRAY 2.2 (ftp <A HREF="ftp://alfred.ccs.carleton.ca">alfred.ccs.carleton.ca</A>
in the /pub/raytrace/POV-RAY directory).  There is a utility to convert 3D
Studio 3DS files to POV files (from
<A HREF="ftp://avalon1.viewpoint.com/avalon/utils/converters/3dspov18.zip">ftp://avalon1.viewpoint.com/avalon/utils/converters/3dspov18.zip</A>).  It is not
perfect.  It will not convert textures, and I ran into some bugs with certain
models.  It did work well enough to convince me that a raytracer can enhance
certain scenes considerably.  Here is what I found:
<P>
1) Raytracing at the highest quality setting is about 7 times slower than 3D
Studio's metal shading with shadows and reflections turned on.
<P>
2) Raytracing improves scenes with many highly reflecting surfaces.
<P>
3) Raytracing can add a lot of detail to a scene through its calculations of
reflections and refractions with no additional work by the model builder.
<P>
4) The 3D Studio renderer output looked as good as the raytracer output with
scenes with few reflective surfaces, or by virtue of geometry, had single
level reflections.  That, to me, says a lot about the high quality of 3D
Studio's rendering engine.
<P>
5) Some scenes had surprising results with the raytracer, because we are not
use to seeing them, such as multilevel reflections of shadows.  Yes, it is
more realistic, and therefore, you have to be a little more "realistic" with
reflectivity settings for materials.
<P>
I also did a non-scientific test with a friend by asking her which images she
liked better, the 3D Studio rendered images, or the POV raytraced images.  I
took identical models and rendered them with both systems.  She knows nothing
about computer graphics.  Invariably, the raytraced images were preferred.
Her comments were "there is more to them".  Presumably, this means she saw
more reflection nuances in the raytraced images.
<P>
In conclusion, the speed of the raytracer is slow, but not so slow that I
would not use it for final output of stills.  We all have time when our
computers are sitting idly doing nothing (POVRAY also lets you interrupt
rendering part way and resume it later).
<P>

<P>
Brian Hoffman (<A HREF="mailto:bhoffman@mail.valverde.edu">bhoffman@mail.valverde.edu</A>) comments:
<P>
The argument that raytracing is too slow to use for animation is not always
correct.  It's important to remember that raytracing is not an all-or-nothing
proposition.  First, the only things in a scene that are candidates for
raytracing are reflective objects, objects with refractive transparency, and
shadows.  These elements may take up only a small portion of a given scene.
Secondly, you may not need to raytrace every reflective object, every
transparent object, or every shadow in a scene.
<P>
That's why I like the approach Lightwave uses.  First you have separate global
toggles for enabling/disabling raytracing for reflection, refraction, and
shadows.  In addition there are also local per surface and per light controls.
If you select a reflection map for a reflective surface, then that surface's
reflections will not be raytraced.  If you do not select a reflection map, the
reflections will be raytraced.  Similarly, refraction for a surface with
transparency will only be raytraced if an index of refraction other than 1.0
is assigned to it.  The shadow types for spotlights can be set to be
raytraced, shadow mapped, or none.
<P>
These features allow you to mix raytraced methods with mapping methods in the
same scene.  You can have a glass ball with mapped reflection, raytraced
refraction, and raytraced shadows.  Another glass object might have traced
reflection, non-refractive transparency, and shadow-mapped shadows.  And so on.
<P>
With selective application of raytracing to limited parts of a scene, it is
sometimes possible to get an increase in realism without paying a huge penalty
in rendering time.  (Of course, it is possible to really explode your
rendering times.  Example:  A close view of a glass sphere with raytraced
refraction, and raytraced reflections for the exterior AND interior surfaces.
Inner surface raytraced reflections combined with raytraced refraction causes
rendering times to go through the roof.  I've learned to raytrace only
exterior surface reflections in these situations.)

Testing SIPP versus Raytracers under DOS,
</A></FONT>
by Alexander Enzmann (<A HREF="mailto:Alexander_Enzmann@star9gate.mitre.org">Alexander_Enzmann@star9gate.mitre.org</A>)
</H4>
This describes a somewhat informal testing of the SIPP rendering library
versus a beta version of the Polyray v1.8 (DOS based) renderer.  The image
used for the purposes of this test was the level 2 sphereflake from Eric
Haines' SPD library.
<P>
If you are really interested in benchmarks of various raytracers, Eric Haines
has published them in Ray Tracing News on various occasions.  This is simply
an evaluation of how a scanline renderer compares to a renderer that
implements both zbuffer rendering and raytracing.  (Polyray is in the middle
of the pack as far as speed of Share/Freeware raytracers goes.  I've got
numbers if anyone cares.)
<P>
In order to have the images at least somewhat resemble each other, a custom
shader was written for the SIPP file that does a simple horizon based color
change.  If the Z component of the reflection of the view direction about the
normal was above 0 then the sky color was used, else the ground color.  This
gives a first order approximation to reflections.  The actual code for the
shader is given below (along with the corresponding one used for Polyray when
performing zbuffer renderering).
<P>
I can make available an image that shows the result of each of the six runs
shown below if people want it.
<P>
Without shadows:
<P>

    SIPP 3.1       Polyray v1.8/    Polyray v1.8/
                   ZBuffer          raytrace

</PRE>
<P>
For this particular test case, my conclusions are:
<P>
<OL>
   <LI>SIPP is faster but really hogs memory.
   <LI>Raytracing isn't all that slow compared to scanline
      rendering.  A 4x difference between SIPP without shadows
      and Polyray with recursive raytracing is pretty reasonable.
   <LI>Polyray's zbuffer renderer is wasting a lot of time shading
      pixels more than once.
   <LI>Polyray is also wasting quite a bit of time generating
      shadow maps, writing them to disc, then reading them
      back in.
   <LI>With a little effort, scanline rendering can give good results.
      However, with even less effort a raytracer gives much better
      results.
</OL>
<P>
Other notes:
<P>
Sphereflake is kinda nasty to a polygon renderer due to the large number of
polygons required for a smooth looking sphere.  Tetra or Gears might have been
a better choice.  (Any takers?)
<P>
SIPP consistently clipped the ground polygon one pixel short of the right and
bottom edges of the image, leaving two lines with the color of the background.
<P>
256x256 shadow maps look pretty crummy.  By upping them to 512x512 and running
in a DOS box under Windows to get Virtual memory (remember I'm using a 4Mb
machine), they were improved but still had noticable artifacts.  This had a
severe impact on runtime with all the swapping going on.
<P>
The sizes for each sphere in SIPP were:  30 for the big ball, 15 for the next
level, and 6 for the smallest balls.  SIPP appears to use a standard lat/long
tessellation of the spheres.  (The "size" in these cases refers to the number
of subdivisions around the equator.  It's a parameter to SIPP when you create
a sphere.  The change in # of sides was necessary so I wouldn't run out of
memory from too many polygons.  It also is a hack at adaptive subdivision
based on screen size.)
<P>
Both the SIPP library and Polyray v1.8 were compiled with the Watcom 10.0 C
compiler for D0S 32 bit protected mode.  The machine used was a 486DX/33 with
4Mb of RAM.
<P>
SIPP images were renderered at 257x257 and rescaled to 256x256.  This is the
standard filter/corner mode of antialiasing specified in the SPD benchmarks.
An external program was used to rescale the SIPP image since it has only
supersampling.  Shadowmaps were generated at 256x256, also due to memory
limitations.
<P>
Lights were turned into spot lights in order to support the generation of
shadowmaps.  Since Polyray uses square lights when a depth map is used, a spot
light function was defined to make them match the ones used in SIPP.
