Before I start, a quick request:  if you're a commercial user of Radiance,
Greg Ward (<A HREF="mailto:greg@hobbes.lbl.gov">greg@hobbes.lbl.gov</A>), the author, would like to hear from you as
soon as possible.  Radiance is developed under the Department of Energy's
funding.  If you can give a testimonial that this package has helped you
commercially, you could help keep its funding intact.  You can also contact
Greg via 510-486-4757 voice, 510-486-4089 fax.
<P>
Well, I was going to talk about the great research presented at SIGGRAPH this
year, but if you went then you already know, if you didn't then you should
consider getting the Proceedings.  For some reason I found more of the papers
directly useful to me this year than in the past few years.
<P>
So, instead, I'll talk about something totally mundane and banal, and yet
totally amazing:  Saturday morning cartoons.  Specifically, "Reboot" on ABC.
It's an entirely 3D computer graphics rendered cartoon.  The character
animation is not fantastic, there are no shadows, and one can make a whole
bunch of other quibbles, but who cares?!  This show makes it clear how far
computer graphics has come, that it's used for a weekly cartoon show.  It's
fun to watch and figure out how effects were done (and there are some nice
animated textures and whatnot).  Some of the models are wonderfully elaborate
- I watch it and say to myself "hours and hours of modeling".  The show even
answered a question I've had:  what does it look like if you move something
through a static turbulence function?  That is, you apply Perlin noise and get
a rendering of a marble ball; now, what happens if the ball moves but the
noise function does not move along with it?  I figured a "swimming through
marble" effect would happen.  They use this effect ("it's a feature, not a
bug") for an animated worm-like thing that crawls around on the main bad guy.
Anyway, how can you dislike a show where the old, wise character is named
Phong?
<P>
The other banal-yet-cool thing I've noticed is "Magic Carpet" for the Intel
PC.  There's a demo version at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uml.edu/">ftp.uml.edu</A> and ftp.uwp.edu in
msdos/games/demos/magic.zip.  Pretty amazing stuff:  you fly over textured 3D
terrain and can bank and change altitude, sorta like DOOM without the "fixed
head" perspective.  Definitely worth checking out, even if you don't like
games.  The real game includes output for 3D glasses (well, I can see 3D with
my regular glasses, but you know what I mean) and also random dot stereogram
output in realtime.  Amusing!
<P>
As usual, there's a big backlog of stuff I haven't put in this issue, but I
thought I'd get this one out the door.  Still, there should be more than
enough to keep you busy.  The announcement of a RenderMan implementation from
a non-Pixar source (and shareware at that) is probably the most amazing thing
in this issue, and there are lots of other interesting sites and resources.
More when I find the time...

Additional information:
<P>
<PRE>
Title    : managing director
Company  : Animagic & Animagic Development
Actually : doing computer graphics, animations, and development.
           (i.e. having fun and getting paid along the way :)
Using    : PC Platform - 3D Studio, proprietary tools.
           SGI Platform - Alias PowerAnimator, proprietary tools.
</PRE>
<P>
Interests:
<P>
Almost anything that is related to three-dimensional computer graphics,
animations, raytracing, commercial productions, broadcast design, high-end
digital video and commercial production, software development (graphics).
<P>
Special Interests:
<P>
Autodesk's 3D Studio and development of IPAS routines for 3D Studio.
<P>
So what about me ?:
<P>
I'm both a programmer and computer animator that has been able to combine
the best of both worlds. It has been five years since I formed my own
business called Animagic specialized in 3D computer graphics for broadcast
design. Alongside this, development of software also played a major role.
Currently the development and production departments are separated due to
the confusion created by our extensive list of services. The development
department is currently developing IPAS routines for 3D Studio and in-house
proprietary tools for both the PC and the Silicon Graphics platforms.
It has been five wonderful years, and with the current state of progress
the next five years will be even better in terms of new development.
<P>
I started with computer graphics back in late 1985, when the Commodore
Amiga computers were first introduced. This is where I got my first taste
for computer graphics and animations with a package called Videoscape from
Aegis, designed by Allen Hastings (currently the developer of Lightwave).
By today's standards this package would be a real old-timer where 3D geometry
had to be entered by hand (coordinates and polygons) in ASCII. So back in
those days creating a twenty second animation was about a month's work. Today
of course, this can be done in just hours :) I've been able to follow the
evolution in the computer graphics industry from that point on, and quickly
started to do some experimental raytracing with the Amiga port of DBW Render.
That's where the fascination of raytracing got the best of me :) I've used
those good old Amigas for a few years and about four years ago switched to
bigger and better platforms and software (and never regretted it).

Rayshade Related
<P>
It looks like the time has come to throw in the towel.
<P>
I have a "version 4.1" floating around, waiting for me to get to some
documentation-hacking and general cleaning up.  But between dissertation
research/writing, moving to the opposite coast, and attempting to have
something resembling a Life, it looks unlikely that I'll be able to wrap
things up before the end of the year.
<P>
As such, it's probably best if I simply stopped work on the freely-available
version of rayshade for the time being, and let whoever wants to release a
rayshade-based "netshade" (or whatever) go to it.  If I am not mistaken, a
group of interested people have already set up a mailing list (David? Nick?)
to discuss such matters -- I'll let the "TraceCore" folks speak up for
themselves on this.
<P>
I'll keep the mailing list going until the "netshade" future looks a bit
more firm.
<P>
Thanks to everybody who has contributed to rayshade over the years, and
thanks for your patience during the last couple of years in particular.

Tiny Review of _Ray Tracing Worlds with POV-Ray_ [v2.2] (Waite Group book)
<P>
I have had it for a couple of weeks now.  From what I have seen so far, it is
a good book to use for a tutorial sort of thing for Moray, and it does go into
some detail with regard to editing povray source, but I'm not so sure that I
would recommend it strictly as a reference guide for povray.  As a reference
source for povray, it comes nowhere near as complete as the povray manual.

Major Announcement : New POV FTP Site
<P>
Despite the following, <A HREF="ftp://ftp.uwa.edu.au/">ftp.uwa.edu.au</A> continues to be the official secondary
POV-Ray FTP site until further notice.
<P>
A new FTP site has been set up for POV-Ray.  It is <A HREF="ftp://ftp.povray.org/">ftp.povray.org</A> !  Yes, our
very own domain.  And instead of a 50mB disk allocation, it currently has
about 1.7 gigabytes of disk space available.  Currently it has more or less
what was (and still is) up at uniwa, but you can expect it to expand over
time, particularly when the POV CD-ROM is published.
<P>
This machine is connected via a T1 to the Internet.  Currently, it shares the
same T1 as <A HREF="ftp://wcarchive.cdrom.com/">wcarchive.cdrom.com</A>, so in reality you'll be sharing the link with
up to 140 other people at peak load times.  But the machine itself is more or
less ours for the time being ; it is provided as a free community service by
Walnut Creek CD-ROM and has no other FTP sites hosted right now.  [This will
probably change sooner or later.]
<P>
Please start using this site and do let me know of problems via email to
<A HREF="mailto:ftp-bugs@povray.org">ftp-bugs@povray.org</A> ; I've only just finished configuring the FTPD and it's
possible there may be a few glitches here and there.
<P>
BTW, I'd like to thank Walnut Creek for offering us this free, no-strings-
attached service.  Get their catalogue by fingering <A HREF="mailto:info@cdrom.com">info@cdrom.com</A> if you want
more information.  Also, many thanks go to Toivo Pedaste of the UWA for
tolerating us for so long (:-).

is no longer updated, near as I can tell. -EAH]

MGF: Materials and Geometry Format,
</A></FONT>
by Greg Ward (<A HREF="mailto:greg@hobbes.lbl.gov">greg@hobbes.lbl.gov</A>)
</H4>
MGF was developed by myself with help from Rob Shakespeare, Ian Ashdown and
Holly Rushmeier.  It will probably end up being the standard for representing
light fixture geometry as part of a new IES (Illuminating Engineering Society)
standard for luminaire data, but that's still down the road aways.  In the
meantime, I am trying to get people to play with the parser and scene/object
library to work out problems in the specification and the code, and in hopes
of simplifying and promoting data exchange between us research types.
<P>
Here is a reprint of a recent posting...
<P>
<PRE>
        Announcing MGF:  Materials and Geometry Format
</PRE>
<P>
Here we have yet another proposal for a standard graphics scene
representation, but with a few notable differences:
<P>
<PRE>
        1) The material descriptions are physically-based and
                therefore usable for lighting simulation:  radiosity
                and ray-tracing methods for global illumination.

        2) The package includes an ANSI-C parser that makes writing
                a translator to any native format quick and painless.
                It also includes a nice library of objects and scenes
                culled from the Radiance distribution.

        3) Use of the parser and library is free.
</PRE>
<P>
The language was designed by the author and some other lighting and computer
graphics experts/enthusiasts.  It includes what it needs to include plus a
little bit.  It is by no means the ultimate scene description, and future
attempts to improve the format must be weighed against the benefits of keeping
things simple.  Also, enhancements to the standard will be made in such a way
that they do not place new demands on the programmers who support it.  This
will be accomplished by updating the parser along with the standard, so each
programmer need only support those entities s/he knows how to translate.  The
parser will translate the rest.
<P>
Some other basics about MGF:
<P>
<PRE>
        o It is a compact, human-readable ASCII format
        o Its syntax permits it to be embedded in TCL (I think)
        o It is strictly boundary-representation (for now)
        o It is mostly polyhedral, but supports a few conics
        o Vertices may be named, may have normals, and may be shared
        o Colors and materials may also be named and put in libraries
        o It supports full-spectral colors and arbitrary basis functions
        o It supports one-sided and two-sided surfaces
        o It supports rigid-body transformations and instancing
        o Materials may reflect, transmit and emit light
</PRE>
<P>
To pick up the parser by anonymous ftp, look in the /www/mgf directory of

Blue Moon Rendering Tools RenderMan Implementation,
</A></FONT>
by Larry Gritz (<A HREF="mailto:gritz@seas.gwu.edu">gritz@seas.gwu.edu</A>)
</H4>
   I am happy to announce the availability of the Blue Moon Rendering Tools
(BMRT), a collection of rendering programs which adhere to the RenderMan(R)
interface standard.  RenderMan is a registered trademark of Pixar.
<P>
   The toolkit consists of a full implementation of the RenderMan standard
which supports ray tracing, radiosity, area light sources, texture and
environment mapping, programmable shading in the RenderMan Shading Language,
motion blur, automatic ray cast shadows, and other advanced features.  The
toolkit also contains quick RIB previewers (using GL or X11) to allow "pencil
tests" of scenes and animations.
<P>
   The BMRT is being distributed as shareware.  Feel free to grab a copy for
evaluation.  If you like it and continue to use it, a "donation" is requested.
In exchange, this makes you a registered user, which means that you will be
informed of bugs and updates, get some support, etc.  It's all outlined in the
License file that comes with the distribution.
<P>
   The toolkit is distributed as binaries for the following platforms:  SGI
running IRIX 4.05 or later, HP 9000 8xx/7xx running HP-UX, Sun SPARC, NeXTSTEP
(HP, Motorola, and Intel).  Other platforms may be supported if requested.
Source code is not distributed, so please don't even bother asking for it.
The toolkit comes with full documentation, several example scenes which
illustrate the various nonstandard features, and several example shaders.
<P>
<PRE>
   The BMRT is available via anonymous FTP:

        FTP to <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gwu.edu/pub/graphics/BMRT/">ftp.gwu.edu</A>
        login as "anonymous", use your email address as the password
        cd /pub/graphics/BMRT
        get the appropriate file for your architecture.
</PRE>
<P>
For more details, feel free to contact me.
<P>
____
<P>
Larry adds later:
<P>
I've recently had a period of unexpected productivity, and have managed to fix
all of the known limitations to the Shading Language compiler for my BMRT
package.  A number of other bug fixes and enhancements have been added
recently.  Updated binaries for SGI and HP are in the FTP site.
<P>
____
<P>
and this, excerpted from another note he posted:
<P>
The rendering methods of the two programs [Pixar's vs.  BMRT] are very
different (REYES vs.  ray tracing/radiosity).  Given this fact, I'd consider
it very good any time BMRT was within an order of magnitude of prman.  Some
people have written to me with timings for particular scenes, and they seem to
be saying that BMRT is about 1/4 the speed of prman.  I think that's pretty
good, but I'm not sure it proves much of anything.  Nobody's given me timing
data on "real" scenes, whatever that means.
<P>
I tend not to even try comparing the two programs in terms of speed, because I
mostly think of them as having very different uses due to their different
rendering techniques and capabilities.  You can let prman run all day, and you
still won't get a radiosity solution.  On the other hand, you can't get true
displacements with BMRT (or any ray tracer).
<P>

<P>
Errata on using Darwyn Peachey's textures from _Modeling and Texturing:  A
Procedural Approach_ (Ebert et al.) with the Blue Moon Rendering Tools.
<P>
Unfortunately, when the FTP site was set up [for the book], the examples from
chapter 8 (Ken Musgrave's chapter) weren't included.  We've since put together
all the (working!) shaders described in this chapter and also sample RIB
scene description files which demonstrate their use, and put them in the FTP
area.  The chapter 8 examples are specifically in the file
musgrave_renderman.tar.Z.  The other subdirectories contain examples from the
other chapters.  FTP from <A HREF="ftp://archive.cs.umbc.edu/texture/">archive.cs.umbc.edu:/texture</A>
<P>
A couple minor incompatibilities made an earlier version of rendrib choke on
some of these shaders.  It's since been fixed, so if you have trouble with any
of the shaders that I say work, just get the newest copy of the BMRT.
<P>
All of the shaders from chapter 2 work fine, except for the following:
<P>
brickant.sl - has a problem due to use of the Du and Dv functions.  In BMRT,
these functions can only take s or t as parameters.  Peachey uses them as
follows (lines 34-35):
<P>
<PRE>
        swidth = abs(Du(ss)*du) + abs(Dv(ss)*dv);
        twidth = abs(Du(tt)*du) + abs(Dv(tt)*dv);
</PRE>
<P>
The following change (which is perfectly equivalent) makes them work properly
with both prman and BMRT:
<P>
<PRE>
        swidth = abs(Du(s)*du) + abs(Dv(s)*dv) / BMWIDTH;
        twidth = abs(Du(t)*du) + abs(Dv(t)*dv) / BMHEIGHT;
</PRE>
<P>
bluemarb.sl - Peachey uses a function definition, which unfortunately is
broken in BMRT.  To make it BMRT-compatible, change this line in Peachey's
code:
<P>
<PRE>
        Ct = marble_color(marble);
</PRE>
<P>
to the following:
<P>
<PRE>
        Ct = color spline(clamp(2*marble + .75, 0, 1),
                PALE_BLUE, PALE_BLUE,
                MEDIUM_BLUE, MEDIUM_BLUE, MEDIUM_BLUE,
                PALE_BLUE, PALE_BLUE, DARK_BLUE, DARK_BLUE,
                DARKER_BLUE, DARKER_BLUE, PALE_BLUE, DARKER_BLUE);
</PRE>
<P>
This is simply folding the function definition into the main routine.  Also
don't forget to delete the function definition itself.
<P>
perturb.sl - works, but note that rendrib takes TIFF files directly as texture
maps, not the .tx files that prman takes.

rendering stuff.  I just presented a paper describing the implementation at
EUROGRAPHICS in Oslo last week.  The paper is available by ftp from

TGA BBS CD ROM review,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines
</H4>
I just couldn't resist making a title with all those acronyms.  TGA is The
Graphics Alternative, a computer graphics related bulletin board run by Adam
Shiffman.  He has made a compendium of the best files from his bulletin board.
This CD ROM has been out for more than half a year (I'm embarrassed to say -
what with the corporate takeover, the disgruntled postmen, and the other
plights that have befallen the Ray Tracing News' Corporate Headquarters [well,
actually, I've just plain been backlogged and busy with work and my family], I
haven't been able to review it).
<P>
So here's an overview of the directory structure and contents:
<P>
<PRE>
    3ds, 40 megs total: 3D Studio files
        3ds/3dsmesh, 22 megs of 3DS mesh files
        3ds/ipas1 and ipas2, 1 meg, about 20-25 IPAS filters total
        3ds/maps, 14 megs of texture GIFs (same as on the first Syndesis
                CD ROM, from what I can tell)
        3ds/util, 1 meg of utilities for 3DS
    anim_utl, 3 megs total: various animation utilities, such as DTA, MPEG
                makers, etc
    anime, 103 megs total: not Japanimation, rather animations; about 120
                FLC/FLI animations and other stuff
    audio, 4 megs total: various sound editing programs
    demos, 11 megs total: sundry graphics demos, like "Unreal", and Doom.
    djgpp, 4 megs, the GNU C++ compiler, v1.11
    dos_view, 4 megs, various dos viewers and image processors
    fractal, 11 megs, various fractal programs, including Fractinit,
                Lparser, and Mandy
    f_prot, 1 meg, popular anti-virus program
    gfxlib, 4 megs, graphics libraries with source, including SVGAKIT and
                TGE (The Graphics Engine)
    gfxsrc, 6 megs, graphics source code, including Graphics Gems I-III,
                rend386, vr386, and other stuff.
    imag_utl, 4 megs, various DOS image utilities
    images, 204 megs, all sorts of stuff, mostly in GIF format:
        images/astrogif, 18 megs, 191 images, various NASA images
        images/fracgif, 7 megs, 48 images, 2D & 3D fractal images
        images/handgif, 5 megs, 49 images, hand painted images
        images/raygif, 61 megs, 384 images, ray traced images (8 bit mapped)
        images/rayjpg, 5 megs, 43 images, ray traced JPEG (lossy 24 bit)
        images/raytga, 69 megs, 88 images, ray traced TGA (24 bit)
        images/textures, 11 megs, 73 images, GIF, TGA and TIF textures,
                some tile, the TIF's are from Paul Bourke's collection
    images/tga, 23 megs, not Targa files, but rather works by
                Adam Schiffman (who made this CD ROM); some nice stuff
    misc, 1 meg of various, such as arj and zip unpackers, Visual Basic DLL
                Also, very useful, is a file description list which
                briefly describes many of the utilities and whatnot.
    os2_view, 1 meg of OS/2 image viewers
    paint, 7 megs of various paint and image processing programs
    ray, 15 megs of ray tracers, including OORT, Polyray, POV, Rayshade,
                Vivid, and the Truespace demos and WorldRender3D demo
    ray_utl, 7 megs of ray tracing utilities, mostly for POV, Polyray, Vivid
                and fairly selective (i.e. not just every utility ever made).
                Modelers include Moray, POVCAD, WinBlobs, PV3D.
    rtnews, 2 megs of utter drivel.  For some reason, <A HREF="rtnv6n1.html">RTNv6n1</A> is missing.
    win_view, 8 megs of Windows viewers and whatnot.
</PRE>
<P>
As you can see, while the focus is ray tracing, with about 250+ of the 450
megs of stuff directly related to this topic, there are also some other things
of interest, such as 3D Studio related resources, fractal generators, other
images, paint programs, graphics libraries, the GNU C++ compiler, audio
utilities, etc etc.  A nice feature for users is that most of the files are
uncompressed and can be executed directly from the CD.
<P>
The image libraries are fairly nice, and unlike the "Tracers and Tracings" CD
ROM (reviewed in <A HREF="rtnv7n4.html#art3">RTNv7n4</A>), there appears to be more editorial work done on the
collections.  Many of the images are of some interest either visually or for
educational purposes, e.g.  focus.gif shows depth of field effects (although
there's an interest [also educational] bug:  the reflections are in focus!)
and 6gear1.gif shows the SPD gears database rendered with 6 different ray
tracers (the bug in Rayshade has been fixed!).  Some of the images in
the ray traced image directories are not ray traced but rather produced by 3D
Studio, but I'm no purist.  One annoying thing with the image libraries is
that there are no catalog files, as on "Tracers and Tracings".  The creator
says in the readme file that he decided against this because the user could
create catalogs, but this excuse is a bit weak.  In terms of portability, time
spent, and hard-disk space, having the catalogs on the CD ROM is a lot better
than making and storing these on a particular machine.  Given that there are
200+ megs of unused CD ROM disk space, storage would not have been a problem.
<P>
The addition of 3D Studio related resources is worthwhile, and of course the
textures are usable elsewhere and the meshes are convertible to other formats
using 3DS2POV and other utilities.  The meshes and textures for the 3DS
section do have catalog images on the disk, which is extremely helpful.
<P>
Editing has also been done on the various program collections; there are no
cases of "8 versions of the same software" clutter.  However, in checking for
some of the better image utilities, I didn't find Image Alchemy (which
"Tracers and Tracings" did have) image converter or the LView windows image
viewer, so either a little too much editing occurred or these worthwhile
programs were unknown to the creator.
<P>
All in all, this is a nice collection of software and images for hobbyists and
others who are interested in modeling and image generation, and beats the
daylights out of downloading all this stuff from the net.  I use a fairly
reasonable Internet connection, but it's a heck of a lot easier to grab stuff
from CD ROMs than deal with unavailable or dropped connections and the amounts
of thumb-twiddling time spent downloading (let alone finding) material on the
net.  Also, if I find some worthwhile software on a CD ROM I can always try to
find the latest version on the net and use that.  All in all, I consider CD
ROM file collections to be a great boon to users of the Internet, saving much
time and energy and bandwidth for us all.  This CD ROM is a welcome addition.

Review of Syndesis Avalon CDROM,
</A></FONT>
by Keith Rule (<A HREF="mailto:keithr@tekig7.pen.tek.com">keithr@tekig7.pen.tek.com</A>)
</H4>
[The Syndesis Avalon CDROM is a snapshot of the <A HREF="ftp://avalon.chinalake.navy.mil/">avalon.chinalake.navy.mil</A> ftp
site as of July 15, 1994.  Avalon is a repository of many hundreds of freely
available 3d models in a variety of formats.]
<P>
I was looking around on <A HREF="ftp://avalon.chinalake.navy.mil/">avalon.chinalake.navy.mil</A> the other day and noticed an
ad for SYNDESIS AVALON CDROM.  I called up Syndesis [(414) 674-5200] and
ordered it on monday (8/22) for $49.95 + shipping, and received it on
Wednesday (8/24).
<P>
It arrived with a CDROM and a booklet.  The booklet contains a Copyright page
which basically says that they (Syndesis) doesn't claim ownership of the files
on the CDROM, just the Copyright to the contents of the CDROM.  Permission
must be obtained from them to make it available on a BBS, multiuser network,
or network.
<P>
I'm not a lawyer (obviously) but I had a bit of trouble understanding the
distinctions they are trying to make here.  Perhaps someone else would share
some insight here.
<P>
In addition to the Copyright notice there is an introduction, and a section on
installation.  The introduction thanks Francisco DeJesus (which I heartly
agree with).  The Installation section talks about the fact that the disk is
an ISO-9660 CDROM which can be read on any computer.
<P>
The rest of the document is just a listing of the files on the CDROM.  The
list serves two purposes, 1) it lets you see what's on the disk with motoring
through the directories, and 2) it shows the mapping between the long file
names used on the avalon site (I assume avalon is a UNIX machine) and shorter
MSDOS names.
<P>
After looking through this I popped the CDROM into my MSDOS machine, brought
up the MS-Windows file manager and started looking through it.  The first
place I looked was under the format_specs directory.  The listing in the
manual showed a dozen or so files, but the MS-Windows file manager showed an
empty directory.
<P>
I started randomly looking around.  Most directories matched the listing, but
many important ones were empty including utils/converters.
<P>
I sent E-mail to Syndesis.  They said I had a driver problem with my PC and
that it would work on another PC.  I tried my PC at work, it had the same
problem.  I sent that info to syndesis.  They said oops, they have a mastering
error and will have to re-master the disk.  This will take about 3 weeks and
they will send a free update to anyone who requests one.
<P>
Aside from that problem, the disk seems to be a direct copy of the
<A HREF="ftp://avalon.chinalake.navy.mil/">avalon.chinalake.navy.mil</A> site.  The only problems I see are that:
<P>
<PRE>
        1) I need several tools on my PC that I'm not sure where
           to find to make this disk useful. These tools are:
                a) An MSDOS equivalent of UNIX uncompress.
                b) An MSDOS equivalent of UNIX Tar
                c) An MSDOS equivalent of gunzip.
                d) PKUNZIP (which I already have)

        2) I'll probably have to get a larger harddisk for all the
           cool stuff I'll be moving off the CDROM.
</PRE>
<P>
I would have preferred that syndesis had uncompressed all the files and then
made their master disk.  One of the advantages of CDROMS is that I don't have
to have all that stuff on may HD.  Unfortunately, I need to pull the models
I'm interested off the CDROM to be able to use them.  Too bad.
<P>
All in all I like the CDROM.  I'm looking forward to the update, and will be
looking for MSDOS equivalents of the UNIX tools I need to access a large
number of the files on this disk.
<P>

[I had hoped to review Syndesis' second volume of models, but won't for now.
Check out <A HREF="rtnv6n3.html">RTNv6n3</A> for a review of the first.  John is putting together a third
volume of models on a CD ROM right now; if you want to get a free one, you can

SIRDS/SIS/stereograms/Holusions/whatever,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines
</H4>
Everyone's doing it.  You've seen them in card stores, you've seen them in
malls, you've seen them in, um, card stores in malls.  Those repeating pattern
posters, books, postcards, tea cozies, and antimacassars, which when you focus
your eyes just so cause a hidden image to pop out and look three dimensional.
Personally, people have waved black and white random dot versions of these in
my face for years without me getting it.  I finally got it this summer, and
can now defocus my eyes and stare off into the middle distance in the blink
of, yes, an eye.
<P>
What worked for me was looking into my computer screen at one and looking at a
reflection in the screen to get my eyes to defocus; there are at least five
other methods of doing it, and I leave it to you to find them in the FAQ (next
paragraph) or in books.  My other piece of advice:  don't try to cross your
eyes, as this is not usually the way to do it as it makes the images reverse
themselves in depth.
<P>
So anyway, I thought I'd try to add this capability to my renderer.  After
puzzling through the SIRDS FAQ (which can be FTPed from <A HREF="ftp://katz.anu.edu.au/pub/stereograms/">katz.anu.edu.au</A>
[150.203.7.91]:  /pub/stereograms, and the FAQ is maintained by Stuart Inglis
(<A HREF="mailto:singlis@cs.waikato.ac.nz">singlis@cs.waikato.ac.nz</A>)) and trying out a few wrong ways, I came up with a
very short addition to my renderer which made some reasonable SIS (Single
Image Stereograms).  I was going to explain it here in depth, but it turns out
there are now a few books that deal with the topic, so who am I to ruin
capitalism?
<P>
Actually, I'll give you the five minute description.  In creating these images
you take a repeating texture pattern and vary it slightly.  The pattern
repeats horizontally every couple of inches or less, i.e.  the repeat pattern
must be less than the width between your eyes (so you can defocus and get a
separate repetition of the pattern for each eye), and should probably be less
than 1-1/2".
<P>
Say you just repeat the texture pattern again and again horizontally without
variation.  You defocus, and the left eye sees a pattern, and the right eye
sees the same pattern, but is actually looking at the repetition of that
pattern one to the right.  Still with me?  (if not, think of a picture, say
Babe Ruth on a baseball card, and a copy of the Babe right next to it -
defocussing makes the left eye look at the left image, the right eye at the
right).  You all (should) know about stereo pairs, where one image is shown to
the left eye and the other to the right and your brain puts them together and
gets a 3D effect.  This idea of having separate similar images go to each eye
is key to SIS.
<P>
Now, since the pattern is repeated a number of times, once defocussed, your
left eye and right eye can move over the entire image and continue to be in
sync.  You will perceive the entire image to be at a distance farther from
where it really is, as the angle formed by left eye/perceived thing/right eye
is a lot smaller than if you just looked at the image normally.  Your brain
knows that when this angle is small, you're (supposed to be) looking at
something far away.
<P>
Now, if you vary this left eye/perceived thing/right eye angle over an image,
your brain will interpret these variations as changes in depth and you'll see
a 3D effect.  I've read a fair bit of gobbledy gook about how to vary the
depth, about dealing with factors like the left eye seeing parts of 3D objects
that the right eye doesn't, and vice versa, but forget all that.  Just think
that, given the basic repeating pattern being seen by each eye, if the right
eye then has to look a little bit to the left of this base pattern at some
feature (compared to what the left eye is seeing), then the brain will
interpret this feature as being closer, since the angle has become larger.
<P>
You now know the essential secret, believe it or not.  The basic algorithm
starts with a texture pattern that the left eye is going to see and will be
repeated.  The "hidden object" which is to appear is used to vary this
pattern.  Say the hidden image is a square floating above a plane.  When the
background of this hidden image is visible, the repeat pattern is not shifted,
when the square is seen, the repeat pattern is then shifted to the left.  The
closer the object is, the more left-shift there is.  [Actually, in practice
these algorithms look at the distance from pixel to pixel, and you can start
from the right or from the middle of the image, but this horizontal shifting
is the basic mechanism] If you look at the image (without defocussing) you'll
notice that the pattern repetition is relatively rapid on the square that is
closer - this makes your eyes form a larger angle with the perceived object
and so you think it is closer.
<P>
So, we've started with a pattern on the left (call this pattern #1) and made a
copy of this pattern just to the right (call this pattern #2), shifting the
data in pattern #1 to the left as required by the hidden image to form #2.
Now we move the process over to pattern #2 and use this as the starting point
for the next repetition, where we form pattern #3 by shifting pattern #2 as
needed.  Pattern #3 is used to form pattern #4, etc, until the image is done.
Algorithmically it's even simpler than this.
<P>
One great feature of these algorithms is that each scan line is entirely
independent of the others.  That is, you can generate a scan line without any
knowledge or effect on the other scan lines, so the entire depth image does
not have to be saved.  Using the left-to-right algorithm above, you don't even
need to keep the whole scan line of z-depths around, since you're shifting as
you go along.  This is what makes the algorithm easy for ray tracers:  you're
simply using the ray tracer to get depths as you go and shifting the pattern
as you go.  Note that you don't really need a ray tracer, though (hey, I had
to mention ray tracing, right?)  - a zbuffer renderer works just fine for the
hidden images, and even just stored images used as depth maps work fine, too.
Notice that a single depth map is used for generating the image, so there's
nothing special about the image generation process.
<P>
The good news is that once you have a half-decent renderer it's pretty easy to
add this algorithm to it.  My first attempt was about 30 new lines of code to
access and shift the texture pattern using the z-depth.  The bad news is that
once you do the easy algorithm, you notice problems.  There's echoing, where
pattern repetitions and elements get intertwined in a way that false 3D
features appear.  There's also a limit to the number of levels of depth in the
basic algorithm, making the 3D object look like it was terraced for farming by
miniature Southeast Asian farmers.  You might try interpolating colors in the
texture to get rid of this artifact (I did), and then it just looks blurry on
the right side of the image.  Me, I finally wrote some additional code that
maintains the exact links between repetitions and uses these precise numbers
to interpolate between samples for output, which reduces blurring (though I
still get some echoing).  Anyway, even with this additional code we're talking
of a total of around 100 new lines (including whitespace and comments).
<P>
I hope this article has given you a flavor of how these images work and are
generated.  If you're seriously interested, look at the reviews that follow of
two books which discuss in depth how to generate these images.  Playing with
these algorithms (and seeing the sorts of goofs you can make) has given me a
greater appreciation of well-constructed commercial images made using this
technique.  It's also interesting to figure out what went wrong with the bad
ones out there.  All in all, a cute technique, but watch it:  if you defocus
too much your eyes will get stuck and you'll see everything in 3D.

Two Books on Stereograms,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines
</H4>
Recently two books have come out about stereograms, _Create Stereograms on
Your PC_, by Dan Richardson, Waite Group Press, 192 pages, 8 color plates,
$26.95, ISBN 1-878739-75-1, and _Hidden Images:  Making Random Dot
Stereograms_ by Bob Hankinson and Alfonso Hermida, QUE Corp, 242 pages, 16
color plates, $24.99, ISBN 1-56529-994-9.  Each book comes with a disk in the
back containing software for the PC.
<P>
Richardson's book collects some of the better stereogram generating tools
together and describes how to use them and how they work.  He spends a little
bit of time describing stereogram history and algorithms, then discusses many
of the different ways the autostereogram effect can be used.  He covers normal
text stereograms, random text stereograms, random dot stereograms, image
mapped stereograms, and icon based stereograms.  Most of these (the exception
being normal text stereograms, which are usually made by hand anyway) have one
or more free or shareware programs presented along with them.
<P>
For random text stereogram generation the SIRTSER program, written by the
author, is provided on the disk and does the job.  The next program presented,
RDSdraw, is a lot more fun.  It's an interactive program which is tailored
towards making depth images for generating random dot stereograms (SIRDS).
It's a fun program in which you can put various objects (boxes, pyramids,
ellipses, etc) and text on the screen and turn the image into a SIRDS.
Another SIRDS program, MindImages, is also presented.  I personally have a
tough time getting MindImages images to work for me on my 15" screen because
they have a wider repetition distance than RDSdraw, but they are nice when
they do work.  There is also a cute program called Shimmer which ameliorates
echoing and helps some people "lock on" to the 3D image quicker.  It's cute,
and the effect reminds me of the book _Snow Crash_ (which is a great trashy
cyberpunk [or cyberpunk parody, it's hard to tell the difference] novel).
<P>
My favorite program is RDSGEN (by Fred Feucht, from a program originally by
Alexander Enzmann), for two reasons.  One is that it generates image
stereograms just like you see in malls, and the other is that source code is
actually provided, a boon for explorers who would like to get their hands
dirty with a little code.  The code provided in the book has evidently been
cleaned up a bit from earlier versions out there.  If you have internet
access, you can find some of these programs at <A HREF="ftp://katz.anu.edu.au/pub/stereograms/">katz.anu.edu.au</A> [150.203.7.91]:
/pub/stereograms, though I didn't notice RDSGEN there.
<P>
The book then goes on to discuss other ways of creating depth maps.  The
wonderful fractal program Fracint is described in this context, and the book's
diskette provides some parameter and map files useful for making SIRDS
(Fractint itself is not included due to space limitations, but is easy to find
on the net at <A HREF="ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/msdos/graphics/frain182.zip">oak.oakland.edu:/pub/msdos/graphics/frain182.zip</A>).  Using the
POV Ray ray tracer with fog to generate depth maps is also discussed, and some
sample scenes are provided.  To end, there's a short chapter on icon based
stereograms and how to generate these with POV Ray.
<P>
____
<P>
Hankinson & Hermida's book focusses on random dot stereograms.  The principles
involved in generating and viewing stereograms are made easily understandable.
Many variations and pitfalls involved in the process are covered.  Along with
the book is the Windows program POPOUT-LITE and some sample depth maps and
random dot stereograms.  Installation was a snap, and the program is easy to
use for generating SIRDS.  Creating depth maps is not so easy; the program
relies on the Windows Paintbrush program to generate these.  Using Paintbrush
finesses having to present and distribute (let alone write) new software, and
this program is understood by many users already.  However, it is not tailored
for creating depth maps and so makes for a lot of work for the user to do
anything non-trivial.  I find RDSdraw much better for the task, as it is made
to create simple 3D object depth maps as part of the program.
<P>
Since I've begun a comparison of this book to Richardson's (which includes
RDSdraw), let's continue.  The software offering of Richardson's is richer.
It includes programs for a wide variety of generation techniques and also
includes a little source code.  Hankinson includes essentially one program;
the nice thing about it is that it's a Windows program which uses the standard
BMP format.  However, after a short while you reach its limits.  You have to
have an artist's abilities and patience to generate depth images using
Paintbrush.  For example, Hankinson would have you draw each depth slice of a
tilted cylinder separately by hand, since Paintbrush doesn't know anything
about 3D objects.  This time would be better spent generating depth maps with
appropriate tools.  Hankinson does briefly discuss other methods of generating
these, e.g.  via POLYRAY.  However, POPOUT-LITE has only 16 levels for depth
information (as does RDSdraw), so images generated with it all have serious
terracing artifacts (where it looks like the object is made out of layers of
corrugated cardboard glued together).
<P>
Hankinson does discuss image stereograms (like those seen in malls) and puts a
few in the set of plates and in the text.  However, there is no software to
generate these images, unlike Richardson's book.  Throughout the book there
are references to POPOUT PRO, which does generate these images and uses 256
depth levels, but it is made available only by paying another $17.50
(discounted from $35) for the program.  There is also a confusion between GP
POPOUT and POPOUT PRO which I have not figured out - they seem to be the same
thing, or maybe different things; it's hard to tell from the text.  Perhaps my
review copy did not come with the discount coupon described in the book, which
might have cleared up some of the mystery.
<P>
Whatever the case, it is misleading to put a sunflower pattern image
stereogram on the cover with a hidden teapot and say "Create Your Own
Incredible 3-D Stereograms with Software Included", when in fact you cannot
generate image stereograms or the teapot depth map with the software provided.
This is a poor way of treating readers and it mars an otherwise fine book.
<P>
Hankinson is good at fully presenting the algorithms involved.  He is thorough
about discussing the various problems which are encountered and ways to fix
these.  About two-thirds of the book purely is about the algorithms, the rest
about describing how to run software.
<P>
In summary, both books have their strengths.  Richardson's gives a quick
once-over of the algorithms, then gets you using the programs in order to
learn more.  Hankinson's spends time giving a coherent, full presentation of
the algorithms involved, then allows some play time to try out SIRDS.  Both
are well written and nicely presented.  Neither book gives a formal
presentation on stereogram theory (nor should they) - for this you'll need to
hit the scientific literature (check the FAQ).  Richardson's software offering
is excellent, but the reader should be comfortable with DOS and some basic
image manipulation software (most readers of this newsletter qualify).
Hankinson's software is simple to use and has on-line help, but doesn't
actually do all that much.  Hankinson explains things thoroughly enough that
you could implement the algorithms after reading his book.  Richardson points
at net resources and provides code; this is both a good and bad thing - it
allows you to get going quickly, but without as deep an understanding of the
techniques available and the problems you'll encounter.  If you want to read
about random dot stereograms in a methodical fashion and don't care so much
about playing (or would rather surf the Internet for software), get
Hankinson's book.  If you would rather play as you go and learn about a wider
variety of stereograms, get Richardson's.

Siggraph Report: The Exhibits,

and he graciously added a few new details.  -EAH]
<P>
THE EXHIBIT FLOOR
<P>
Instead of reporting on the ultra high end stuff I am reporting on low end
stuff that's pretty impressive.  Well, maybe a little high end.
<P>

Rendermorphics from Reality Lab
(408) 486-6956

</PRE>
<P>
At the Rendermorphics booth they were showing an API, which was explained to
me as a software only render engine which is being licensed to 3D software
makers.  This product was rendering like a hardware renderer.  In the booth
they had the Matrox 3D engine (PC)and a Cirrus Logic render engine.  In a very
fair test, it matched the Matrox and beat the Cirrus, though both were indeed
respectable.  The boards also featured Open GL support, while Rendermorphics
said that they plan to support this also.
<P>
[Other vendors at SIGGRAPH included Ithaca Software's new HOOPS on the PC, and
Criterion's RenderWare.  - EAH]
<P>
<PRE>
January update:
Rendermorphics is now directly supported by 3D Labs' GLINT chip, a 3D
rendering engine on a chip being widely adapted by the PC-Mac-Windows NT board
manufacturing community.  It will be even faster as a result when used with
hardware acceleration.
</PRE>
<P>
Cirrus Logic- (510) 226-6218
<P>
The primary advantage to the Rendermorphics API is that they are making it
cross platform compatible on the PC, Mac, Power PC, Windows NT and SGI
(especially the INDY).  Expect to start seeing this incorporated into Lower
Cost 3D software in the next few months.  The test that I saw was rendering at
speeds comparable to my Indigo 2 Extreme.  It featured Phong, Gouraud,
textured, reflected and I believe faceted shading and permitted real time
movement of a lit object.
<P>
They were demoing with a 200 polygon or so torus and a 16,000 poly skeleton.

Animation Master had some very cool demos on their reel this year.  One was a

sophisticated users thought it was Cyberscanned.  But it was done at home by
this guy (Rod Altshul I think was his name) in LA with photos he took of
himself.
<P>
Another piece on their reel was done by a teacher at UCLA extension.  Very
morphy and a good, clear story.  It should have been in the Electronic

The product had very cool inverse kinematics and the ability to take character
actions and add them to a list of character actions in a Direction module.
All versions were under $1K.

challenging, and I'd like to see how fast it renders complex objects.  I think
also around $1K.

Scanline Rendering Previewer,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines due to Chris Cason
</H4>
Chris Cason asks:
<P>
&gt;How much faster is scanline rendering compared to raytracing ? I am<BR>
&gt;considering whether or not a scanline rendering previewer (able to read POV<BR>
&gt;scenes) might not be a good idea, if it were *really* fast.<BR>
<P>
My guess is, no, better yet, just a sec.  OK, POV 2.0beta+ rendered tetra,
4096 polygons, in 56 seconds.  Subtracting out the time to read the database,
call it 52 seconds.  My general software z-buffer renderer (not including
database read) did it in 2 seconds [and I'm working to make it faster].
<P>
Chris also asked about whether doing a scanline previewer for POV-Ray would
be worthwhile.  I replied:
<P>
I'd love to see a reasonable scanline renderer.  The main problem is turning
everything into polygons.  Also, that's where the cost comes in:  a sphere is
just a sphere to POV, but is 2000 polygons to a scanline renderer (or less,
depending on what quality your talking here.  You could get by with maybe 200
polygons per sphere).  Also, as far as CSG - forget it trying to get the
polygonal version of a CSG model, people form companies around doing this
problem.  Though there have been rumors on the net of people doing this in
upcoming shareware...
<P>
Anyway, if you can polygonalize the beastie (or even if it was just a simple
guess), there are at least two resources for doing scanline images.  One is
SIPP, which is pretty good (no front end scripting language, but then you don't
need one for POV integration) - it includes texture mapping and shadowing (!).
There's also VRend, which is more X windows based but the code itself (cobbled
together from various sources) does indeed seem to render stuff.
<P>
SIPP's home (it's also elsewhere, tell me if you have problems):
<A HREF="ftp://isy.liu.se/pub/sipp/">isy.liu.se</A> [130.236.1.3]:  pub/sipp/sipp-3.0.tar.Z - *SIPP* scan line z-buffer
        and Phong shading renderer.  Jonas Yngvesson (<A HREF="mailto:jonas-y@isy.liu.se">jonas-y@isy.liu.se</A>)
<P>
There are some demo programs included, give it a try!
<P>
Info on ZRend is in <A HREF="rtnv7n5.html#art10">RTNv7n5</A>.
<P>
Anyway, it'd be great to have a POV scanline previewer, even with limitations
(since most people work using polygons and simple quadrics and quartics, it'll
make 90% the people out there happy).  You could probably cobble one
together in a few days, adding a front end to SIPP that is simply the POV
script language.  Do it!  Fame!  Fortune!  (well, fame, at least...).
<P>
____
<P>
The above was a pretty old exchange of messages, but hey, I can always hope
that someone will actually make a reasonable z-buffer renderer integrated with
a shareware modeller or as a standalone program.  It shouldn't be *that* hard.

Raysmith,

by Eduardo Bustillo Iceta (<A HREF="mailto:epabuice@bi.ehu.es">epabuice@bi.ehu.es</A>)
</H4>
I'm a recently graduated mechanical engineering student from Spain.  As part
of my end of studies project I have developed a radiosity program with the
following main characteristics:
<P>
<PRE>
  -Monte Carlo integration to compute diffuse illumination:  This permits to
    have refracted shadows, specular and diffuse reflections, blurry
    reflections, translucency, texture mapping and any geometry of light
    sources.

  -Adaptive subdivision:  Objects with big radiosity gradients inside are
    dynamically subdivided during the radiosity process.

  -Ray tracing:  A postprocess of ray tracing is used to calculate the image.
    The main characteristics of the algorithm used are:

      -Depth of field.
      -Stochastic anti-aliasing.
      -Optional 3D glasses stereo view.

  -Acceleration techniques: Three different user selectable techniques
    are incorporated:
      -Binary Object Partitioning
      -Adaptive voxel subdivision (with optimal coordinate system selection)
      -Z-Buffer for first ray acceleration

  -Geometry input:  It reads 3D Studio v2 geometry files so the only geometric
    entity supported is the triangle.

  -Completely written in ANSI C:  This way it may be compiled in any system.
    Actually, my work was done in a PC but I've tried and succeeded in
    compiling it with no modifications on a DEC OSF/1 and a HP-UX server.

I asked about benchmarking, and Eduardo replied:
<P>
I have done some quick benchmarking tonight.  The only 3DS to ray tracer file
exchanger that I have is the one I wrote last year for POV.  I used two
example scenes:
<P>
-Scene 1:  Three spheres (mirror, glass and diffuse) with one light.  About
800 polygons.  Resolution 320x240:
<P>
<PRE>
            POV 2.2                      RAYSMITH(default configuration)
             736 s                         337 s
</PRE>
<P>
-Scene 2:  Based upon F. Sillion's example in Foley-Van Dam (plate III.27)
with some added features.  Raysmith showed interobject reflections (even
through reflective or transmitting objects) while POV didn't (it's a
ray-tracer).  On the other hand Raysmith can't handle sharp shadows (needed in
some cases).  About 6200 polygons.  Resolution 320x240:
<P>
<PRE>
            POV 2.2                      RAYSMITH(default configuration)
             340 s                         129 s
</PRE>
<P>
I don't have a file exchanger for RAD386 or Rayshade but in the version that I
have access to, both of them use a similar accelerating structure:  uniform
voxel subdivision.  Raysmith has user selectable accelerating parameters (it
uses adaptive voxel subdivision) such as grid resolution, maximum grid depth
or minimum number of objects per voxel.  I think that with these options it
should be theoretically faster (or at least as fast).

Many people thought rendering was the same as "scan conversion" or
rasterizing.  Others thought that rendering and image synthesis are
synonymous.  It is clear that there is not agreement on what rendering means.
It is also clear that some think that the "realistic" is implicit in "image
synthesis".  One thing is for sure-- there is no global agreement!

Jevans' Temporal Coherence for Ray Tracing,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines

From a Rayshade user:<BR>
&gt;Also, my animation images are VERY similar from image to image.  It would<BR>
&gt;be nice to save the intermediate calculations from say image n-1 and apply<BR>
&gt;that knowledge to image n.  This might consist of saving all the ray<BR>
&gt;results from the previous image and looking for what hasn't moved in the<BR>
&gt;next frame of the animation, or, it could be as simple as auto-detecting<BR>
&gt;that, given the motion of objects, certain areas do not require recalculation.<BR>
&gt;I would gladly trade RAM for execution speed any day, any day, any day....<BR>

<P>
His method should be easy to do with Rayshade:  essentially, you record each
ray shot in each voxel the ray hits.  When something moves in a voxel or to
another voxel, only those rays in those voxels which have had changes
(movement, entry/exit, etc of objects) need to be recomputed for the next
image.  Jevans claims an almost 4x speedup.  Only works for a static camera,
of course (i.e. the camera doesn't move).
<P>
Memory intensive, of course (lots of rays get stored), but Jevans has a method
of keeping this reasonable:  he needs only 64 bytes per voxel.  He stores a
resolution independent grid of 16x16 bits, essentially dividing the image into
16x16 blocks.  Each eye ray (and its children) then has a particular bit which
gets set for it; as you propagate the ray it marks this bit in each voxel hit
by it and its children.  For the next frame you move objects and note which
voxels are touched.  "or" together all the dirty voxel bitmasks and you get a
list of which of the 16x16 blocks need to get recomputed.  Simple stuff, the
messy part for Rayshade is keeping the frame by frame coherence info around in
a nice fashion.

You might want to look at _Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats_ by James D.
Murray and William van Ryper, published by O'Reilly and Associates, July, 1994
(928 pages, softcover, with CD ROM, ISBN 1-56592-058-9, $59.95).  Email:
<A HREF="mailto:orders@ora.com">orders@ora.com</A>
<P>
There's a CDROM readable by Mac, PC, and Unix systems with a bunch of
utilities (most of which you can find, with some amount of effort, on the net
if you know where to look).  While I can quibble with the claim on the back
cover that it is "the only file format book you'll ever need," it is quite
complete.
<P>
It attempts to cover a lot more ground that Kay and Levine and does most of it
fairly well (though there is a lot missing, too.  For instance, for legal
reasons many of the proprietary formats, such as Kodak Photo CD, are covered
with not much more than a pointer to the "owner" of the format).
<P>
The book is organized into three parts, an Overview, describing the basics of
graphics file formats, their care, and feeding, as well as other bits and
pieces of useful tutorial information.  The second part covers the formats
themselves.  The final part is a description of the CDROM and pointers to
getting additional software.
<P>
There are a few glitches in the index.  For instance, if you look up "PICT"
format, you find only a single reference to a brief mention of the format in
the introduction, but if you look up "Macintosh PICT," you find a reference to
both the introduction and an article in the main body of the text.
Unfortunately, the article doesn't really tell you much about PICT format
either, but just points you at the Apple technical note.  There is software on
the CDROM, which I haven't tried, that apparently does read and handle PICT,
though.
<P>
In my copy there is also an error in binding which may not be in every copy.
The list of figures is inserted in the middle of the table of contents entries
for section two.
<P>
In summary, _Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats_ is an useful, if sometimes
necessarily incomplete, resource.

[Disclaimer:  I was sent a free review copy of the book by O'Reilly and
Associates, so I may have a small bias.  However, I have no connection with
the publisher other than as a small contributor to their financial success due
to twenty one of their other publications gracing my bookshelves that I've
personally bought over the years.  :-)]

Another short review:
<P>
From John Grieggs' comp.graphics FAQ:
<P>
Good introduction to graphics file format issues for both vector and raster
formats, plus specific descriptions of nearly 100 file formats.  CD-ROM
includes sample images, original format spec documents where available, and C
code snippets.  Also a lot of free and shareware image conversion/manipulation
software for Unix, DOS, Windows, and Mac.  Much of this is available on the
net (and indeed the book tells you where), but having it all pulled together
is very useful.  Tom Lane (<A HREF="mailto:tgl@sss.pgh.pa.us">tgl@sss.pgh.pa.us</A>) says:  "My only complaint is
that there are too many typos in the printed text.  Check the original spec
document whenever you find something unclear or dubious."

We have received several requests for a complete listing of all of the format
specification documents on the CD-ROM accompanying our new book, _The
Encyclopedia of Graphics File Formats_ by James D.  Murray and William
vanRyper.  The CD-ROM contains specs from such vendors as Adobe, Aldus, Apple,
IBM, Microsoft, and Silicon Graphics, along with test images and code examples
for many of the formats.  Also on the CD-ROM is a set of free or public domain
software and shareware--for MS-DOS, Windows, OS/2, UNIX, and Macintosh
platforms--that will let readers convert, view, and manipulate graphics files
and images.

As author of GBM, which I believe is the source code include on the CD with
the book [I'm not sure what he means; the code on the disk is by the authors
and does not appear to resemble this code.  - EAH], I would like to point out
that the latest version of GBM source is usually available on one of :-

[There are also many ray-tracing and other rendering related things for OS/2
here, too. -EAH]
<P>
I particularly mention this because the latest GBM has fixes and a faster
GIF/TIFF LZW save algorithm.

A good way of getting direct write to a number of formats is to link the whole
thing to the SDSC Image Tools library available at
ftp.sdsc.edu:/pub/sdsc/graphics/imtools.  As i recall, you just organize you
images into their type of internal array, and then just make one call to write
out the file based on the type you want.  I see they have stuff for the
following machines:
<P>
apple_mac, cray_ymp, dec_alpha, dec_mips, dec_vax, hp_700, ibm_rs6000,
next_next, sgi_4d, sun_3, sun_sparc
<P>
I also understand they will be providing source in the near future.
<P>
Image types supported:
<P>
bmp, cur, eps, gif, hdf, ico, icon, iff, mpnt, pbm, pcx, pgm, pic, pict, pix,
ppm, pnm, ps, ras, rgb, rla, rle, synu, tga, tiff, viff, x, xbm, xwd
