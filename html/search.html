<BLOCKQUOTE>
To find information about a topic, simply type in a few keywords. 
The more detailed your query, the more relevant your results.<BR>

<BR>Our search engine also comes with some advanced capabilities 
to help you find exactly what you're looking for. These capabilities 
are best shown with a few examples:<BR>

<DL>
<FORM>
<DT><INPUT SIZE=40 TYPE=TEXT NAME="1" VALUE="+CGI +scripting"><BR>Translated: <I>require CGI, require scripting</I></DT>
<DD>Finds "CGI Scripting", "CGI scripting", and "scripting of type CGI".<BR>
Does not find the lowercase "cgi scripting", nor the abbreviated "CGI script".<BR><BR></DD>

<DT><INPUT SIZE=40 TYPE=TEXT NAME="1" VALUE="-CGI +scripts"><BR>Translated: <I>forbid CGI, require scripts</I></DT>
<DD>Finds "Perl scripts", "Hollywood scripts", and lowercase "cgi scripts".<BR>
Does not find "CGI definitions" nor "CGI scripts".<BR><BR></DD>

<DT><INPUT SIZE=40 TYPE=TEXT NAME="1" VALUE="or CGI and scripts"><BR>Translated: <I>prefer CGI, require scripts</I></DT>
<DD>Finds "Perl scripts", "CGI scripts", and "CGI Scripts".<BR>
Documents with both terms appear higher in the list.<BR><BR></DD>

<DT><INPUT SIZE=40 TYPE=TEXT NAME="1" VALUE="&quot;CGI scripts&quot;"><BR>Translated: <I>require the phrase "CGI scripts"</I></DT>
<DD>Finds "CGI scripts".<BR>
Does not find "CGI Scripts" nor "scripts of type CGI".<BR><BR></DD>

<DT><INPUT SIZE=40 TYPE=TEXT NAME="1" VALUE="and cgi and script*"><BR>Translated: <I>require cgi (case insensitive), require words starting with "script"</I></DT>
<DD>Finds "CGI scripts", "cgi scripting", "Cgi scripter".<BR>
The asterisk is a wildcard representing any four or fewer characters.<BR><BR></DD>

<DT><INPUT SIZE=40 TYPE=TEXT NAME="1" VALUE="not planet and Venus and pictures or images"><BR>
Translated: <I>require Venus (case sensitive), require pictures, forbid planet, prefer images</I></DT>
<DD>First lists "pictures and images of Venus", then "Venus pictures".<BR>
Does not list lowercase "venus picture", nor forbidden "picture of planet Venus".<BR><BR></DD>

<DT><INPUT SIZE=40 TYPE=TEXT NAME="1" VALUE="Where is the *frog*?"><BR>
Translated: <I>ignores common words like where, is, and the - requires words containing "frog"</I></DT>
<DD>Finds "frog", "frogleg", and "bullfrog".<BR>
To suppress the ignore feature, use quotes, as in "Where is the *frog*?".<BR><BR></DD>
</FORM>
</DL>

<BR>Note on case sensitivity - only words or phrases containing an 
upper case character will be treated as case sensitive. 

<BR>
A search on 
"usa" will match "Usa", 
"USA", and "usA", while the term "USA" 
matches only its uppercase version.<BR>

<BR>The asterisk is a powerful search tool, but has some limitations. It 
cannot span words - that is, the query "powerfu*earch" would not match the 
first sentence of this paragraph - and it can represent at most four letters 
or numbers. To avoid overly broad searches, the asterisk can only be used 
in words or phrases which have at least three alpha-numeric characters. 
A search for "th*" would be ignored.</BLOCKQUOTE>
