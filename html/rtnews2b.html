    My thesis research was similar to what John Wallace described,
    being a two pass approach to radiosity to include specular reflection
    and transparency.  Form factors were all calculated via ray tracing,
    however.  I did some brief examination of different ray intersection
    methods along the way (Rubin-Whitted, Kay-Kajiya, and Glassner).

 Just a quick response to your football stadium/teapot example.  When you
subdivide a node, look at its children.  If only one child is non-empty,
replace the original node with its non-null child.  Do this recursively
until the subdivision criterion is satisfied.  I do this in my spacetime
ray tracer, and the results can be big.  The ray propagation can get just
a bit more complex, but there are clever rays to keep it simple (see
John Amanatide's article in Eurographics '87, plus I have a scheme that
         hope to write up soon...).
<P>
  Better yet, go with a hybrid space subdivision/bounding volume scheme,
such as the one described in my spacetime paper (poorly described in the
        ntro to RT notes, but better described in the version slated for the
March issue of CG&A; I'd be happy to mail you a preprint).  I think this
hybrid scheme gives the best of both worlds, and you can use whatever
space subdivision and bounding volume techniques that you like in the
two distinct phases of the algorithm.  I use adaptive space subdivision
and Kay's bounding slabs, and that combination seems to work pretty well.

previous discussion of topic</A></I>
<P>
From: Eric Haines (with a few extra comments than my original letter to Jim)
<P>
        Your article on efficiency is fascinating.  I hope to read it more
carefully tonight and (eventually--we just came under a crunch of work)
comment on it.  Sounds like you've done a lot of serious thought and
speculation on the possibilities.  I agree with the philosophy of objects
each having their own private hierarchies, and having the ability to hook
these hierarchies up however you want.  We've done that on a small scale
with our tesselated spline surfaces:  automatic hierarchy a la Goldsmith &
Salmon (IEEE CG&A, May 1987) for everything, but then octrees for the spline
surfaces themselves.  A nice feature of Goldsmith is that you can weight the
cost of each primitive into the algorithm: multiply its area by some
intersection cost (which you'll probably have to figure out through
experimentation) to give it a weighting.  In this way a torus surface which has
the same size bounding volume as a quadrilateral can be given a higher
weighting factor.  A higher cost has the effect of making the hierarchical tree
less horizontal near the complicated object, i.e. there are more bounding
volumes overall, with a few complicated objects in each.  This is what you
want, since you'd rather spend a little extra time on intersecting bounding
volumes than wasting a lot of time intersecting the empty space around costly
objects.

Response from: Jim Arvo
<P>
    I'm glad you found my article interesting.  All your interesting
    mail finally motivated me to contribute to the discussion.  I
    thought I would toss out a pet idea of mine and see if it sparked
    any debate.  It turns out that Jeff Goldsmith also looked at
    simulated annealing for bounding box hierarchies.  One day one
    of us will get some results.  Hopefully not negative results!
<P>
    With all the talk about octrees and such, it's clear that there
    are a number of potential papers "waiting in the wings".  I've
    been thinking that by getting the right collaborations going,
    we (the ray tracing group) could easily "hand" IEEE several
    related papers, effectively defining a theme issue.  What do
    you think?
<P>
____
<P>
My reply:
<P>
        The efficiency article collection sounds possible.  Another idea which
someone (Mike Kaplan, maybe?  I forget) mentioned at last SIGGRAPH was "A
Characterization of Ten Ray Tracing Efficiency Algorithms".  If well done, this
would be a classic.  There are probably entirely new schemes still to be found,
and certainly trying to optimize and figure out good hybrid methods is an
area ripe for development.  But right now many of the structures and algorithms
are in place, and still have not been fully compared.  Timings are
unconvincing, and statistics are worthwhile but don't tell the whole story.
An in-depth comparison of the major algorithms and techniques to improve these
would be wonderful.  Someday, someday ... well, my hope is that a few of us
could do some writing along these lines, even if it's just brainstorming on
how to compare particular algorithms in a rigorous fashion  (e.g. How can we
simulate a scene mathematically?  OK, idealize each object as a box or sphere
for simplicity.  Now, how do we distribute the points to get realistic
clustering? Once we have a "scene generator" which could create various typical
distributions of objects in a scene, then we have to analyze how this generator
would interact with each algorithm, and be able to predict how each efficiency
scheme deals with the scenes generated.  Or there might be simpler ways to
isolate and analyze each factor which affects the efficiency of a scheme.
Anyway, whatever, but this stuff looks fun!).  Understanding the strengths of
the various techniques seems vital to being able to do any kind of "annealing"
process for optimization.

    Here's a good hack for Ray Tracing News:  When using Tim Kay's heapsort on
bounding volumes in order to get the closest, don't bother to do that for
illumination rays.  I know it seems obvious, but I never thought to do it.
<P>
The obvious corollary to that idea has a little more reach to it.  Since
illumination rays form the bulk of the rays we trace, getting the nearest
intersection is of limited value.  In addition, if CSG is used, more times
occur when the nearest intersection is of less value.  This seems to indicate
that space tracing techniques are doing some amount of needless work.  Since
it doesn't really cost that much, perhaps it is not a flaw, but maybe space
tracers should consider approaches that don't worry about where along the path
we are and optimize that problem instead.

Bug for the Day,
</A></FONT>
by Eric Haines
</H4>
{This will be pretty unexciting for those who never intend to implement an
octree subdivision scheme.  For future implementers, I hope you find it of
use:  it took me quite a few hours to track this one down, so I think it is
worth going into.}
<P>
        This bug was one I had when implementing octree subdivision for ray
tracing.  The basic algorithm used was Glassner's:  once you intersect the
octree structure, move the intersection point in one half of the smallest
cube's dimension in the direction normal to the wall hit.  In other words,
find out what cube is the next cube by finding a point that should be well
inside of it, then translating this point into integer octree coordinates
and traversing the octree downwards until a leaf node is found.
<P>
        However, there are some subtle errors that can occur with moving to the
next octree cube.  My favorite is almost hitting the edge of a cube, moving
into the next cube, then getting caught moving to the cube diagonal to this
cube, i.e. moving from cube 1 to 2 to 3 ...
<P>
<PRE>
        X--&gt;
        +---+---+
      ^ | 2 | $ |       Numbers are the order of cubes moved through.
      | +---#---+
      Y | 1 | 3 |
        +---+---+
          ^________ray started here, and hit almost at the "#".
                   (ray is in +X, +Y direction)
</PRE>
<P>
This went into an infinite loop, going between 2 and 3 forever.  The reason
was that when I hit the boundary 1&2 I would add a Y increment (half minimum
box size) to the intersection point, then convert this to find that I was
now in box 2.  I would then shoot the ray again and it would hit the
wall at 2&$.  To this intersection point I would add an X increment.  However,
what would happen is that the Y intersection point would actually be ever so
slightly low - earlier when I hit the 1&2 wall adding the increment pushed us
into box 2.  But now when the Y intersection point was converted it would
put us in the 1+3 boxes, and X would then put us in box 3.  Basically, the
precision of the machine made the mapping between world space and octree
space be ever so slightly off.
<P>
        The infinite loop occurred when we shot the ray again at box 3.  It
would hit the 3/$ wall, get Y incremented, and because X was ever so slightly
less than what was truly needed to put the intersection point in the 3+$
boxes, we would go back to box 2, ad infinitum.  Another way to look at this
is that when we would intersect the ray against any of the walls near the
"#" point, the intersection point (due to roundoff) was always mapping to
box 1 if not incremented.  Incrementing in Y would move it to box 2, and in
X would move it to box 3, but then the next intersection test would yield
another point that would be in box 1.  Since we couldn't increment in
both directions at once, we could never get past 2 and 3 simultaneously.
<P>
        This bug occurs very rarely because of this: the intersection points
all have to be such that they are very near a corner, and the mapping of the
points must all land within box 1.  This problem occurred for me once in a
few million rays, which of course made it all that much more fun to search
for it.
<P>
        My solution was to check the distance of the intersections generated
each time: if the closest intersection was a smaller distance from the origin
than the closest distance for the previous cube move, then this intersection
point would not be used, but rather the next higher would be.  In this way
forward progress along the ray would always be made.
<P>
        By the way, I found that it was worthwhile to always use the original
ray origin for testing ray/cube intersections - doing this avoids any
cumulative precision errors which could occur by successively starting from
each new intersection point.  To simulate the origin starting within the cube
would simply test only the 3 cube faces which faced away from the ray
direction (this was also faster to test).
<P>
        Anyway, hope this made sense - has anyone else run into this bug? Any
other solutions?

Don't ever refer to pixels as rows and columns.  It makes it hard to get the
order (row,column)?  (column,row)?  right.  Refer to pixels as (x,y)
coordinates.  Not only is that the natural system to do math on them, but it
is much easier to visualize in a debugging environment, as well as running the
thing.  I use the -x and -y npix switches on the tracer command line to
override any settings and have found them to be much easier to deal with than
the -r and -c that seem to be everywhere.  Note that C's normal array order is
(I think.  I always get these things wrong.)  (y,x).

        Next "RT News" issue I'll include a write-up of Goldsmith/Salmon which
should hopefully make the algorithm clearer, plus some little additions I've
made.  I've found Goldsmith/Salmon to be a worthwhile, robust efficiency scheme
which hasn't received much attention.  It embodies an odd way of thinking
(I have to reread my notes about it when I want to change the code), as there
are a number of costs which must be taken into account and inherited.  It's
not immediately intuitive, but has a certain sense to it once all the pieces
are in place.  Hopefully I'll be able to shed some more light on it.
